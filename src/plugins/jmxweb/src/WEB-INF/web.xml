        Options specific for certain application

        on these options. The value is a JSON object with
        the detector's name as key and the options as value.
        E.g. '{glassfish: {bootAmx: false}}' would prevent
        the booting of the AMX subsystem on a glassfish with
        is done by default.

        This option specifies in which order the key-value properties within
        ObjectNames as returned by "list" or "search" are returned. By default
        this is the so called 'canonical order' in which the keys are sorted
        alphabetically. If this option is set to "false", then the natural
        order is used, i.e. the object name as it was registered. This option
        can be overridden with a query parameter of the same name.

      <description>
        Whether to include a stacktrace of an exception in case
        of an error. By default it it set to "true" in which case
        the stacktrace is always included. If set to "false", no
        stacktrace is included. If the value is "runtime" a stacktrace
        is only included for RuntimeExceptions. This global option
        can be overridden with a query parameter.

      <description>
        When this parameter is set to "true", then an exception thrown
        will be serialized as JSON and included in the response
        under the key "error_value". By default it is "false". This global
        option can be overridden by a query parameter of the same name.

      <description>
        If discoveryEnabled is set to true, then this servlet will listen
        for multicast discovery request and responds with its agent URL and
        other server specific information. Instead of setting this confog variable,
        discovery can be also enabled via the system property "jolokia.discoveryEnabled"
        or the environment variable "JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY_ENABLED".

        In addition the config parameter "discoveryAgentUrl" can be used to set the the agent's URL.
        By default, auto detection (after the first request was processed by the servlet)) of the URL is used.
        If the URL is set, then discovery is automatically enabled (i.e. there is
        no need to set "discoveryEnabled=true"). This configuration option
        is especially useful if the WAR is used in a proxy setup. Instead of setting the URL
        here, it can be set also either via the system property "jolokia.discoveryAgentUrl" or the
        environment variable "JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY_AGENT_URL".
