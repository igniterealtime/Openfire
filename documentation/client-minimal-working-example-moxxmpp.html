        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            This document provides a minimal working example of a client implementation using the moxxmpp library, making
            it connect to a running Openfire server.

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://codeberg.org/moxxy/moxxmpp">moxxmpp</a> is a pure Dart library that was originally built for
            the Moxxy XMPP client. It has since been separated and can be used standalone.
        </p>
        <p>
            This guide describes how to use moxxmpp to connect to Openfire. It provides nothing more than a minimal
            working example, intended as a stepping stone to for client developers that get started with a new project.
        </p>

        <h2>Preparations</h2>

        <p>
            In this example, a client connection will be made against a running Openfire server. For ease of
            configuration, the 'demoboot' setup of Openfire is used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'demoboot' setup of Openfire allows one to start a fresh installation of Openfire into a certain
            provisioned state, without running any of the setup steps. When running in 'demoboot' mode:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>an administrative account is created using the username 'admin' and password 'admin'</li>
            <li>two users are automatically created: 'jane' and 'john' (both using the value 'secret' as their password)</li>
            <li>the XMPP domain name is configured to be 'example.org' (for ease of use, configure 'example.org' to be an alias of '127.0.0.1' in your hosts file!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To start Openfire in 'demoboot' mode, you can invoke the Openfire executable using the <code>-demoboot</code>
            argument, as shown below.
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Starting Openfire in 'demoboot' mode.</legend>
            <pre><code>$ ./bin/openfire.sh -demoboot</code></pre>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            That should be everything that you need to get Openfire running. Background information on the 'demoboot'
            mode can be found in <a href="./demoboot-guide.html">Openfire's Demoboot Guide</a>.

        <p>
            To start the project, create a file named <code>pubspec.yaml</code> in an empty directory, and copy in the
            code below.

        <p>
            Finally, build and run the test client, using the instructions below.

        <p>
            If all goes well, this will print a short exchange of XMPP data.

            Note that this example disables important security features. You should not use this for anything important!
