<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This document outlines how to <b>manually</b> customize the SSL support in
Openfire. As of Openfire 3.2 certificate management can be performed from the
Admin Console. However, if needed you can still manually manage certificates
using JDK 1.5 tools.

<font color="red"><b>Important note:</b></font>
Once the setup process is completed Openfire will create self-signed certificates
for the assigned Openfire's domain. Most users should either get the created
certificates signed by a Certificate Authority or replace the created certificates
with your own certificates.</p>

<p>Openfire's SSL support is built using the standard Java security
SSL implementation (javax.net.ssl.SSLServerSocket). In this document, we will
describe how use the standard JDK 1.5 tools to accomplish these tasks.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
A server SSL connection uses two sets of certificates to secure the
connection. The first set is called a "keystore". The keystore contains
the keys and certificates for the server. These security credentials
are used to prove to clients that the server is legitimately operating
on behalf of a particular domain. If your server will only need to act
as one domain, you only need one key entry and certificate in the keystore.
Keys are stored in the keystore under aliases. Each alias corresponds
to a domain name (e.g. "example.com").
</p>
<p>
The second set of certificates is called the "truststore" and is used
to verify that a client is legitimately operating on behalf of a
particular user. In the vast majority of cases, the truststore is
empty and the server will not attempt to validate client connections
using SSL. Instead, the XMPP authentication process verifies users
in-band. However, you may wish to require SSL authentication for
certain clients when security is especially important and the number
of clients connection to the server is relatively small.
</p>
<p>
Certificates attempt to guarantee that a particular party is who they
claim to be. Certificates are trusted based on who signed the certificate.
If you only require light security, are deploying for internal use on
trusted networks, etc. you can use "self-signed" certificates.
Self-signed certificates encrypts the communication channel between
client and server. However the client must verify the legitimacy of the
self-signed certificate through some other channel. The most common client
reaction to a self-signed certificate is to ask the user whether
to trust the certificate, or to silently trust the certificate is
legitimate. Unfortunately, blindly accepting self-signed certificates
opens up the system to 'man-in-the-middle' attacks.

</p>
<p>
The advantage of a self-signed certificate is you can create them for
free which is great when cost is a major concern, or for testing and evaluation.
In addition, you can safely use a self-signed certificate if you can verify
that the certificate you're using is legitimate. So if a system administrator
creates a self-signed certificate, then personally installs it on a client's
truststore (so that the certificate is trusted) you can be assured that
the SSL connection will only work between the client and the correct server.
</p>
<p>
For higher security deployments, you should get your certificate signed
by a certificate authority (CA). Clients truststores will usually contain
the certificates of the major CA's and can verify that a CA has signed a
certificate. This chain of trust allows clients to trust certificate from
servers they've never interacted with before. Certificate signing is similar
to a public notary (with equivalent amounts of verification of identity,
record keeping, and costs).
</p>
<h2>Sun JDK 1.5 security tools</h2>
<p>
The Sun JDK (version 1.5.x) ships with all the security tools you need
to configure SSL with Openfire. The most important is the
<tt>keytool</tt> located in the <tt>JAVA_HOME/bin directory</tt> of the
JDK. Sun JVMs persist keystores and truststores on the filesystem as
encrypted files. The <tt>keytool</tt> is used to create, read, update,
and delete entries in these files. Openfire ships with a self-signed
"dummy" certificate designed for initial evaluation testing. You will need
to adjust the default configuration for most deployments.

</p>
<p>
In order to configure SSL on your server you need complete the
following tasks:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decide on your Openfire server's domain.</li>
  <li>Create a self-signed SSL server certificate for your server
domain. Note: you may already have one if your Openfire server
domain matches an existing web domain with SSL.
If so, you can skip to step 4.</li>
  <li>[Optional] Have a certificate authority (CA) certify the SSL
server certificate.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
      <li>Generate a certificate signing request (CSR).</li>

      <li>Submit your CSR to a CA for signing.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Import the server certificate into the keystore. Note: if you are
going to use a self-signed certificate
generated in step 2, the certificate is already imported and you can
skip this step.</li>
  <li>Remove default certificates from the keystore.</li>
  <li>Import client certificates into the truststore.</li>
  <li>Adjust the Openfire configuration with proper keystore and
truststore settings.</li>

</ol>
<h3>1. Decide on a Server Domain</h3>
<p>
The Openfire server domain should match the host name of the server;
for example, "example.com". Your user accounts will have addresses with
the format "user@example.com" like email addresses. We'll assume
the domain is "example.com" for the rest of the examples.
</p>
<h3>2. Create a self-signed server certificate</h3>
<p>
In order to create a self-signed server certificate go to the command
line and change directories to the <tt>resources/security</tt>
directory of your Openfire installation. You should see the default
<tt>keystore</tt> and <tt>truststore</tt> files. First, you should
change the default keystore
password:

</p>
<p><tt>keytool -storepasswd -keystore keystore</tt></p>
<p>
keytool will ask for the old password (by default it is <tt>changeit</tt>)
then the new password.
Now we'll create a certificate using the keytool:
</p>
<p><tt>keytool -genkey -keystore keystore -alias example.com</tt></p>
<p>
where you should substitute your server's name for <tt>example.com</tt>.
The keytool will ask for the store password, then several pieces of
information required for the certificate. Enter all the information but remember 
to <b>complete with your server's name when asked for your first and last name</b>. 
After you have entered all the required information, keytool will ask you to 
verify the information and set a key password.
<b>You must use the same key password as the store password.</b> By default
you get this by simply hitting 'enter' when prompted for a key password.</p>

<p>If you later change the keystore password remember to change the entries'
password as well using the keytool:</p>

<p><tt>keytool -keypasswd -alias example.com -keystore keystore</tt>
</p>
<h3>3. Obtain a CA signed certificate</h3>
<p>
If you decide to get a CA signed certificate, you must first export the
certificate in the
standard CSR format. You can do this with the keytool:
</p>
<p><tt>keytool -certreq -keystore keystore -alias example.com -file
certificate_file</tt></p>
<p>
Where you should substitute your server's name for <tt>example.com</tt>

and the name of the
certificate file you wish to produce for <tt>certificate_file</tt>.
Submit the generated CSR to the CA and follow their instructions to get
it signed.
</p>
<h3>4. Import server certificates</h3>
<p>
If you had a CA sign your server certificate, or if you have an
existing SSL certificate,
you must import it using the keytool.
</p>
<p><tt>keytool -import -keystore keystore -alias example.com -file
signed_certificate_file</tt></p>
<p>
It is important that the alias not already have an associated key or
you'll receive an error.
</p>
<h3>5. Remove default certificates</h3>
<p>

After importing your certificate you must remove the default certificates
using the keytool.
</p>
<p><tt>keytool -delete -keystore keystore -alias rsa</tt></p>
<p><tt>keytool -delete -keystore keystore -alias dsa</tt></p>
<h3>6. Import client certificates</h3>
<p>
If you require clients to verify themselves using certificates, obtain
their certificates and import them into the truststore file rather than
the keystore. First, you should change the default truststore
password:
</p>
<p><tt>keytool -storepasswd -keystore truststore</tt></p>
<p>
keytool will ask for the old password (by default it is <tt>changeit</tt>)
then the new password.
Now import each certificate using the keytool:

</p>
<p><tt>keytool -import -keystore truststore -alias user_name -file
certificate_file</tt></p>
<h3>7. Configure Openfire</h3>
<p>
Open the Openfire Admin Console in your favorite
browser and add or change the following system properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>xmpp.socket.ssl.active -- set to 'true' to active SSL</li>
  <li>xmpp.socket.ssl.port -- the port to use for SSL (default is
5223 for XMPP)</li>
  <li>xmpp.socket.ssl.storeType -- the store type used ("JKS" is
the Sun Java Keystore format used by the JDK keytool). If this property is 
not defined, Openfire will assume a value of "jks".</li>

  <li>xmpp.socket.ssl.keystore -- the location of the keystore file
relative to your Openfire installation root directory. You can leave this property
blank to use the default keystore.</li>
  <li>xmpp.socket.ssl.keypass -- the keystore/key password you
changed in step 2.</li>
  <li>xmpp.socket.ssl.truststore -- leave blank to not use a
truststore, otherwise the location of the truststore file relative to
your Openfire installation root directory.</li>
  <li>xmpp.socket.ssl.trustpass -- the truststore/key password you
changed in step 6.</li>
</ul>
You will need to restart the server after you have modified any of the above system properties.
