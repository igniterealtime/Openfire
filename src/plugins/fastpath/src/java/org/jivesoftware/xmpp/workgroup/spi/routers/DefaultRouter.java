/**
 * <p>Routes all incoming requests to any 'available' request queue

 * <p>Most workgroups should install a default router as the last router in their
 * router chain to make sure that all requests are routed to at least one queue.</p>
 * <p>Routing meta-data is expected to be a subpacket in iq-join-queue with a root
 * element 'info' in the 'http://jivesoftware.com/live/metadata' namespace and consist
 * of item-name-value pairs. For example</p>
 * <code><pre>
 * &lt;iq&gt;
 *   &lt;join-queue&gt;
