Can be used to reuse or throttle expensive resources such as\n  database connections.\n  \n## 2.0 Release Warning\n\nThe 2.0.0 release removed support for variable argument callbacks.  When you acquire\na resource from the pool, your callback *must* accept two arguments: (err, obj)\n\nPreviously this library attempted to determine the arity of the callback, but this resulted\nin a variety of issues.  This change eliminates these issues, and makes the acquire callback\nparameter order consistent with the factory.create callback.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install generic-pool\n    \n## History\n\n    2.0.4 - July 27 2013\n       - Merged #64 - Fix for not removing idle objects (contributed by PiotrWpl)\n\n    2.0.3 - January 16 2013\n       - Merged #56/#57 - Add optional refreshIdle flag.

This is a side\neffect of the idleTimeoutMillis behavior -- the pool has a \nsetTimeout() call registered that is in the event loop queue, so\nnode won't terminate until all resources have timed out, and the pool\nstops trying to manage them.  \n\nThis behavior will be more problematic when you set factory.min > 0,\nas the pool will never become empty, and the setTimeout calls will\nnever end.  \n\nIn these cases, use the pool.drain() function.  This sets the pool\ninto a \"draining\" state which will gracefully wait until all \nidle resources have timed out.  For example, you can call:\n\n```js\n// Only call this once in your application -- at the point you want\n// to shutdown and stop using this pool.\npool.drain(function() {\n    pool.destroyAllNow();\n});\n```\n    \nIf you do this, your node process will exit gracefully.\n    \n    \n## Documentation\n\n    Pool() accepts an object with these slots:\n\n                  name : name of pool (string, optional)\n                create : function that returns a new resource\n                           should call callback() with the created resource\n               destroy : function that accepts a resource and destroys it\n                   max : maximum number of resources to create at any given time\n                         optional (default=1)\n                   min : minimum number of resources to keep in pool at any given time\n                         if this is set > max, the pool will silently set the min\n                         to factory.max - 1\n                         optional (default=0)\n           refreshIdle : boolean that specifies whether idle resources at or below the min threshold\n                         should be destroyed/re-created.  optional (default=true)\n     idleTimeoutMillis : max milliseconds a resource can go unused before it should be destroyed\n                         (default 30000)\n    reapIntervalMillis : frequency to check for idle resources (default 1000),\n         priorityRange : int between 1 and x - if set, borrowers can specify their\n                         relative priority in the queue if no resources are available.\n                         see example.  (default 1)\n              validate : function that accepts a pooled resource and returns true if the resource\n                         is OK to use, or false if the object is invalid.  Invalid objects will be destroyed.\n                         This function is called in acquire() before returning a resource from the pool. \n                         Optional.  Default function always returns true.\n                   log : true/false or function -\n                           If a log is a function, it will be called with two parameters:\n                                                    - log string\n                                                    - log level ('verbose', 'info', 'warn', 'error')\n                           Else if log is true, verbose log info will be sent to console.log()\n                           Else internal log messages be ignored (this is the default)\n\n## Priority Queueing\n\nThe pool now supports optional priority queueing.  This becomes relevant when no resources \nare available and the caller has to wait. `acquire()` accepts an optional priority int which \nspecifies the caller's relative position in the queue.\n\n```js\n // create pool with priorityRange of 3\n // borrowers can specify a priority 0 to 2\n var pool = poolModule.Pool({\n     name     : 'mysql',\n     create   : function(callback) {\n         // do something\n     },\n     destroy  : function(client) { \n         // cleanup.  omitted for this example\n     },\n     max      : 10,\n     idleTimeoutMillis : 30000,\n     priorityRange : 3\n });\n\n // acquire connection - no priority - will go at end of line\n pool.acquire(function(err, client) {\n     pool.release(client);\n });\n\n // acquire connection - high priority - will go into front slot\n pool.acquire(function(err, client) {\n     pool.release(client);\n }, 0);\n\n // acquire connection - medium priority - will go into middle slot\n pool.acquire(function(err, client) {\n     pool.release(client);\n }, 1);\n\n // etc..\n```\n\n## Draining\n\nIf you know would like to terminate all the resources in your pool before\ntheir timeouts have been reached, you can use `destroyAllNow()` in conjunction\nwith `drain()`:\n\n```js\npool.drain(function() {\n    pool.destroyAllNow();\n});\n```\n\nOne side-effect of calling `drain()` is that subsequent calls to `acquire()`\nwill throw an Error.\n\n## Pooled function decoration\n\nTo transparently handle object acquisition for a function, \none can use `pooled()`:\n\n```js\nvar privateFn, publicFn;\npublicFn = pool.pooled(privateFn = function(client, arg, cb) {\n    // Do something with the client and arg. Client is auto-released when cb is called\n    cb(null, arg);\n});\n```\n\nKeeping both private and public versions of each function allows for pooled \nfunctions to call other pooled functions with the same member. This is a handy\npattern for database transactions:\n\n```js\nvar privateTop, privateBottom, publicTop, publicBottom;\npublicBottom = pool.pooled(privateBottom = function(client, arg, cb) {\n    //Use client, assumed auto-release \n});\n\npublicTop = pool.pooled(privateTop = function(client, cb) {\n    // e.g., open a database transaction\n    privateBottom(client, \"arg\", function(err, retVal) {\n        if(err) { return cb(err); }\n        // e.g., close a transaction\n        cb();\n    });\n});\n```\n\n## Pool info\n\nThe following functions will let you get information about the pool:\n\n```js\n// returns factory.name for this pool\npool.getName()\n\n// returns number of resources in the pool regardless of\n// whether they are free or in use\npool.getPoolSize()\n\n// returns number of unused resources in the pool\npool.availableObjectsCount()\n\n// returns number of callers waiting to acquire a resource\npool.waitingClientsCount()\n```\n\n## Run Tests\n\n    $ npm install expresso\n    $ expresso -I lib test/*.js\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2013 James Cooper &lt;james@bitmechanic.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
