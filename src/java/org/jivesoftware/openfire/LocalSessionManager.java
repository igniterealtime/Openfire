/**
 * A LocalSessionManager keeps track of sessions that are connected to this JVM and for
 * which there is no route. That is, sessions that are added to the routing table are
 * not going to be stored by this manager.<p>
 *
 * For external component sessions, incoming server sessions and connection manager
 * sessions there is never going to be a route so they are only kept here. Client
 * sessions before they authenticate are kept in this manager but once authenticated
 * they are removed since a new route is created for authenticated client sessions.<p>
 *
 * Sessions stored in this manager are not accessible from other cluster nodes. However,
 * sessions for which there is a route in the routing table can be accessed from other
 * cluster nodes. The only exception to this rule are the sessions of external components.
 * External component sessions are kept in this manager but all components (internal and
 * external) create a route in the routing table for the service they provide. That means
 * that services of components are accessible from other cluster nodes and when the
 * component is an external component then its session will be used to deliver packets
 * through the external component's session.
