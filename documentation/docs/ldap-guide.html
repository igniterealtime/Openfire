<h1>Jive Messenger LDAP Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This document details how to configure your Jive Messenger installation to use 
an external LDAP store when authenticating users and loading user profile information.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) has emerged as a dominant standard 
for user authentication and for storage of user profile data. It serves as a 
powerful tool for large organizations (or those organizations integrating many 
applications) to simplify user management issues.
</p>
<p>
By default, Jive Messenger stores all user data in a database and performs 
authentication using database lookups. The LDAP module replaces that 
functionality and allows Jive Messenger to:
<ul>
<li>
Use a LDAP server to authenticate a user's identity.
</li>
<li>
Load user profile information from a LDAP directory.
</li>
</ul>
<b>Note:</b> Jive Messenger treats the LDAP directory as read-only.
</p>
<p>
This document will guide you through configuring LDAP support in Jive Messenger. These
instructions assume that you're a competent LDAP user, and that you're familiar 
with Jive Messenger setup issues.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
In order to configure your server to use LDAP:
<ol>
<li>
Stop Jive Messenger.
</li>
<li>Edit <tt>conf/jive-messenger.xml</tt> in your Jive Messenger installation folder as described below.
</li>
<li>
Restart Jive Messenger.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Editing the Config File</h3>
<p>
Open the configuration file <tt>conf/jive-messenger.xml</tt> from your Jive Messenger installation in your favorite
editor and add or change the following settings. Properties flagged with (<font color="red"><b>*</b></font>) must be set, 
all other properties are optional:
</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="red"><b>*</b></font> provider.user.className -- set the value to "org.jivesoftware.messenger.ldap.LdapUserProvider".</li>
<li><font color="red"><b>*</b></font> provider.auth.className -- set the value to "org.jivesoftware.messenger.ldap.LdapAuthProvider".</li>
<li><font color="red"><b>*</b></font> ldap.host -- LDAP server host; e.g. localhost or machine.example.com, etc.</li>
<li>ldap.port -- LDAP server port number. If this property is not set, the default value is 389.</li>
<li><font color="red"><b>*</b></font> ldap.baseDN -- the starting DN that searches for users will performed with. The entire   subtree under the base DN will be searched for user accounts.
</li>
<li>ldap.alternateBaseDN -- a second DN in the directory can optionally be set. If set, the alternate base DN will be used for authentication and loading single users, but will not be used to display a list of users (due to technical limitations).
<li>ldap.adminDN -- a directory administrator's DN. All directory operations will be performed
    with this account. The admin must be able to perform searches and load user records. The user does
    not need to be able to make changes to the directory, as Jive Messenger treats the directory as read-only.
    If this property is not set, an anonymous login to the server will be attempted.
</li>
<li>ldap.adminPassword -- the password for the directory administrator.</li>
<li>ldap.usernameField -- the field name that the username lookups will be performed on. If this property is not set,
    the default value is <tt>uid</tt></li>
<li>ldap.nameField -- the field name that holds the user's name. If this property is not set, the default value is
    <tt>cn</tt></li>
<li>ldap.emailField -- the field name that holds the user's email address. If this property is not set,
    the default value is <tt>mail</tt>.</li>
<li>ldap.searchFilter -- the search filter that should be used when loading users. If this property
    is not set, the default search will be for users that have the attribute specified by
		ldap.usernameField.
<li>ldap.debugEnabled -- a value of "true" if debugging should be turned on. When on, trace
    information about buffers sent and received by the LDAP provider is written to System.out</li>
<li>ldap.sslEnabled -- a value of "true" to enable SSL connections to your LDAP server. If you
    enable SSL connections, the LDAP server port number most likely should be changed to 636.</li>
<li>ldap.initialContextFactory --  the name of the class that should be used as an initial context
 		factory. if this value is not specified, "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory" will be used instead.
		Most users will not need to set this value.
<li>ldap.autoFollowReferrals -- a value of "true" indicates that LDAP referrals should be automatically
		followed. If this property is not set or is set to "false", the referral policy used is left up to
		to the provider. A referral is an entity that is used to redirect a client's request to another server. 
		A referral  contains the names and locations of other objects. It is sent by the server to indicate 
		that the information that the client has requested can be found at another location (or locations), 
		possibly at another server or several servers. 
<li>ldap.connectionPoolEnabled -- a value of "false" disables LDAP connection pooling. If this
		property is not set, the default value is "true".
</ul>
<p>
Below is a sample config file section:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;jive&gt;
...
    &lt;ldap&gt;
        &lt;host&gt;&lt;/host&gt;
        &lt;port>389&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;usernameField&gt;uid&lt;/usernameField&gt;
        &lt;nameField&gt;cn&lt;/nameField&gt;
        &lt;emailField&gt;mail&lt;/emailField&gt;
        &lt;baseDN&gt;ou=People;dc=example;dc=com&lt;/baseDN&gt;
        &lt;adminDN&gt;cn=Directory Administrator&lt;/adminDN&gt;
        &lt;adminPassword&gt;&lt;/adminPassword&gt;
    &lt;/ldap&gt;
    &lt;provider&gt;
        &lt;user&gt;
            &lt;className&gt;org.jivesoftware.messenger.ldap.LdapUserProvider&lt;/className&gt;
        &lt;/user&gt;
        &lt;auth&gt;
            &lt;className&gt;org.jivesoftware.messenger.ldap.LdapAuthProvider&lt;/className&gt;
        &lt;/auth&gt;
    &lt;/provider&gt;
...
&lt;/jive&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You'll most likely want to change which usernames are authorized to login to the
admin console. By default, only the user with username "admin" is allowed to login. However,
you may have different users in your LDAP directory that you'd like to be administrators. The
list of authorized usernames is controlled via the <tt>adminConsole.authorizedUsernames</tt>
property. For example, to let the usersnames "joe" and "jane" login to the admin console:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;jive&gt;
...
    &lt;adminConsole&gt;
    ...
        &lt;authorizedUsernames&gt;joe, jane&lt;/authorizedUsernames&gt;
    &lt;/adminConsole&gt;
...
&lt;/jive&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><a name=""><h2>Custom Search Filter</h2></a></p>

<p>By default, Jive Messenger will load all objects under the baseDN that
have the attribute specified by <tt>ldap.usernameField</tt>. In the
case that the username field is set to "uid", the search for all users
would be "(uid=*)". However, there are cases when this logic does
not work -- for example, when a directory contains other objects besides
users but all objects share "uid" as a unique identifier field. In that
case, you may need to specify a custom search filter using 
<tt>ldap.searchFilter</tt>. As an example, a search filter for all users 
with a "uid" and a "cn" value of "joe" would
be:</p>

<pre>(&(uid={0})(cn=joe))</pre>

<p>The "{0}" value in the filter above is a token that should be present in
all custom search filters. It will be dynamically replaced with "*" when
loading the list of all users or a username when loading a single user.</p>

<p>Some custom search filters may include reserved XML entities such as
"&". In that case, you must enter the search filter into the jive-messenger.xml
file using CDATA:

<pre>&lt;searchFilter&gt;&lt;![CDATA[(&(sAMAccountName={0})(|(givenName=GEORGE)(givenName=admin)))]]&gt;&lt;/searchFilter&gt;</pre> 
 
<p><a name="ctxFactory"><h2>Custom Inital Context Factory</h2></a></p>

<p>
Some LDAP servers or application servers may require that a different LDAP
initial context factory be used rather than the default (com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory).
You can set a custom initial context factory by adding the following to jive_config.xml:

<pre>&lt;ldap&gt;
    ... other ldap settings here 
    &lt;initialContextFactory&gt;com.foo.factoryClass&lt;/initialContextFactory&gt;
&lt;/ldap&gt;</pre>   
</p>

<p><a name="connectionPool"><h2>Connection Pooling</h2></a></p>

The default LDAP provider (Sun's) support pooling of connections to the LDAP
server. Connection pooling can greatly improve performance, especially on
systems with high load. Connection pooling is enabled by default, but can
be disabled by setting the Jive property <tt>ldap.connectionPoolEnabled</tt> 
to <tt>false</tt>:

<pre>&lt;ldap&gt;
    ... other ldap settings here 
    &lt;connectionPoolEnabled&gt;false&lt;/connectionPoolEnabled&gt;
&lt;/ldap&gt;</pre></p>

<p>
You should set several Java system properties to change default pool settings.
For more information, see the following pages:
<ul>

http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/connect/pool.html</a>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/connect/config.html">
http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/connect/config.html</a>

</ul>
</p>
	    
<p>Note that if you turn on LDAP debugging, connection pooling will not be enabled.
If SSL LDAP mode is enabled, you must set a system property to enable pooling of
SSL LDAP connections.</p>    

<h2>LDAP FAQ</h2>
<p>

<b>Can I create new users through Jive Messenger when using LDAP?</b>
<ul>No, Jive Messenger treats LDAP directories as read-only. Therefore, it's
not possible to create or edit users through the application.</ul>

<b>Why is the list of usernames not sorted in the admin console when using LDAP?</b>
<ul>Several popular LDAP servers such as OpenLDAP do not support server-side
sorting of search results. On those servers, users will appear out of order.
However, you can enable client-side sorting of search results by setting 
<tt>ldap.clientSideSorting</tt> to true in the XML configuration file.</ul>

<b>I switched to LDAP and now cannot login to the admin console. What happened?</b>
<ul>If you can no longer login to the admin console after switching, one of two
things most likely happened:<ol>
			 <li>By default, only the username "admin" is allowed to login to the
			 admin console. Your directory may not contain a user with a username
			 of "admin". In that case, you should modify the list of usernames authorized 
			 to login to the admin console (see above).
			 <li>You may have set the baseDN to an incorrect value. The LDAP module
			 recursively searches for users under the node in the directory specified 
			 by the baseDN. When the baseDN is incorrect, no users will be found.
</ol>
You can also enable debugging to get more information from the LDAP module. To
do this, add &lt;log&gt;&lt;debug&gt;&lt;enabled&gt;true&lt;/enabled&gt;&lt;/debug&gt;&lt;/log&gt; 
to your <tt>conf/jive_messenger.xml</tt> file. Log statements will be written 
to the <tt>logs/debug.log</tt> file.
</ul>
