<p>Wildfire is a powerful instant messaging (IM) and chat
server that implements the XMPP protocol. This document will guide 
you through installing Wildfire as a standalone
application. For a full list of features and more information, please
visit the Wildfire website: <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.org/wildfire"
 target="_top">http://www.jivesoftware.org/wildfire</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Windows</h3>
Run the Wildfire installer. The application will be installed to <tt>c:\Program Files\Wildfire</tt> by default.
 
 <h3>Linux/Unix</h3>
 
 Choose either the RPM or tar.gz build. If using the RPM, run it using your package manager to install Wildfire to <tt>/opt/wildfire</tt>:

 <p><tt>rpm -ivh wildfire_3_0_0.rpm</tt></p>

 
 If using the .tar.gz, extract the archive to <tt>/opt</tt> or <tt>/usr/bin</tt>:

 <p><tt>tar -xzvf wildfire_3_0_0.tar.gz<br>
 mv wildfire /opt</tt></p>

 <p><b>Note:</b> the .tar.gz build does not contain a bundled Java runtime (JRE). Therefore, you must have JDK or JRE 1.5.0 (Java 5) or later installed on your system. You can check your java version by typing "java -version" at the command line and (if necessary) upgrade your Java installation by visiting http://java.sun.com.</p>

  </ul>
<h2>Setup Overview</h2>
<p>To complete the installation of Wildfire, you'll need to
perform each of the following steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#database">Database</a> - if you choose to use an external database, you must
 prepare your database for Wildfire. </li>
  <li><a href="#config">Setup</a> - Use the built-in web-based setup
tool to setup and verify the server configuration.</li>

  <li><a href="#tools">Admin Console</a> - use the web-based admin tool to
manage the server.</li>
</ol>

<p>This document also includes information on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#windows">Running under Windows</a>
    <li><a href="#unix">Running under Unix/Linux</a>

    <li><a href="#plugins">Installing and using plugins</a>
</ul>

<h2><a name="distribution">Files in the Distribution</a></h2>
<p> The files in your distribution should be as follows (some
sub-directories omitted for brevity): </p>
<pre>wildfire/
 |- readme.html
 |- license.html
 |- conf/
 |- bin/
 |- jre/
 |- lib/
 |- plugins/
     |- admin/
 |- resources/
     |-database/
     |-security/
 |- documentation/</pre>

<ul> 
	 <li>The <tt>conf</tt> directory is where Wildfire stores
configuration files.</li>

  <li>The <tt>bin</tt> directory contains the server executables. Depending
on which distribution you installed, different executables will be available.</li>
  <li>The <tt>jre</tt> directory contains a Java 5 runtime that is bundled with the Windows and RPM versions of Wildfire.</li>
  <li>The <tt>lib</tt> directory contains libraries necessary for
running Wildfire.</li>

  <li>The <tt>plugins</tt> directory contains server plugins. By
default, Wildfire ships with a web-based admin console plugin.</li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/database</tt> directory contains SQL schema files to
create new Wildfire databases, as well as upgrade scripts for
existing installations. </li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/security</tt> directory is where Wildfire
maintains keystores to support SSL connection security.</li>

  <li>The <tt>documentation</tt> directory contains server
documentation.</li>
</ul><p>

<h2><a name="database">Setup the Database</a></h2>
<p>Wildfire can store its data in an embedded database or you can choose to use
an external database such as MySQL or Oracle. If you would like to use an external database,
you must prepare it before proceeding with installation by running the appropriate database
schema. View the <a href="database.html">database
setup</a> documentation for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="config"></a>Setup the Server</h2>
<p>A web-based, "wizard" driven setup and configuration tool is built
into Wildfire. Simply launch Wildfire (platform-specific instructions below) and use a web browser to
connect to the admin console. The default port for the
web-based admin console is 9090. If you are on the same machine as Wildfire, the
following URL will usually work: 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:9090">http://127.0.0.1:9090</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="tools">Admin Console</a></h2>
<p>After completing the above steps, Wildfire will be configured
and you can use the web-based admin console to administer
the server. The URL should be the same as you used to setup the server
unless you changed the port during the setup.<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="windows">Running Wildfire in Windows</a></h2>

<p>If you used the Wildfire installer, a shortcut for starting the
a graphical launcher is provided in your Start Menu. Otherwise, run wildfire.exe in the <tt>bin/</tt> directory of your
Wildfire installation. A button on the on the launcher allows
you to automatically open your web browser to the correct URL to finish 
setting up the server: 

<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/launcher.png" alt="Wildfire Launcher" width="400" height="300" align="center">
</div>
</p>

<h3>Windows Service</h3>
<p>If you're running Wildfire on Windows, you will likely want to
run Wildfire as a standard Windows service after initial setup.
If you used the Windows installer, a <tt>wildfire-service.exe</tt> file
will be in the <tt>bin</tt> directory of the installation. You can use
this executable to install and control the Wildfire service.

</p>

From a console window, you can run the following commands:
<ul>
		<li><tt>wildfire-service /install</tt> -- installs the service.
		<li><tt>wildfire-service /uninstall</tt> -- uninstalls the service.
		<li><tt>wildfire-service /start</tt> -- starts the service
		<li><tt>wildfire-service /stop</tt> -- stops the service.

</ul>

<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/windows_service.png" alt="Windows Service" width="557" height="223" align="center">
</div>
</p>

<p>You can also use the Services tool in the Windows Control Panel to start and
stop the service.</p>

<p>Note: the graphical launcher is not compatible with the Windows service
at this time. If you install the service, you should use service controls
as described above to control the server rather than the graphical launcher.</p>

<h3>Custom Parameters</h3>

<p>Advanced users may wish to pass in parameters to the Java virtual machine (VM) to customize
    the runtime environment of Wildfire. You can do this by creating vmoptions files in the bin/
    directory of your Wildfire installation. For the Windows service, you'd create a new text
    file called wildfire-service.vmoptions. Each parameter to the VM should be on a new line of
    the file. For example, to set the minimum heap size to 512 MB and max VM heap size to 1024 MB, you'd use:

<pre>-Xms512m
-Xmx1024m</pre>

To create parameters for the normal launcher, create a file called wildfired.vmoptions (since
    the wildfire.exe launcher invokes the wildfired.exe executable to actually start the server).</p>

<h2><a name="unix">Running Wildfire in Linux/Unix</a></h2>

You can start and stop Wildfire using the <tt>bin/wildfire</tt> script in your Wildfire installation:

<p>
<tt>
# ./wildfire<br>

Usage: ./wildfire {start|stop}<br>
# ./wildfire start<br>
Starting wildfire
</tt></p>

If you would like to install Wildfire as a service, two scripts are provided in the <tt>bin/extra</tt>
directory:
<ul>
    <li>redhat-postinstall.sh -- automatically installs Wildfire as a service on Red Hat. It does so by creating a "jive" user and then copying the wildfired script to your init.d directory. This script must be run as root. Please see the comments in the script for additional information.</li>
    <li>wildfired -- script to run Wildfire as a service. You must manually configure this script. See the comments in
the script for additional details.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="plugins">Plugins</a></h2>

Plugins add additional features and protocol support to Wildfire. After setting up your
Wildfire installation, you may want to download and install plugins to enhance your
server. Plugins can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://www.jivesoftware.org/wildfire/plugins.jsp">plugins page</a> on jivesoftware.org.

<h3>Installing Plugins</h3>

Each plugin comes packaged as a .jar (JAR) file. After download the plugin, you can deploy it
by copying the plugin file to the <tt>plugins/</tt> directory of your Wildfire installation. A
plugin monitor will automatically extract the plugin into a directory and install the plugin in Wildfire.


<h3>Managing Plugins</h3>

Plugins can be managed inside the Wildfire admin console. You can also manually delete a plugin at any time by
deleting its JAR file (Wildfire will automatically remove the plugin from memory and delete it's directory when you
do so).
