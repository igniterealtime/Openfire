Jitsi Meet - Secure, Simple and Scalable Video Conferences 
====
Jitsi Meet is an OpenSource (MIT) WebRTC JavaScript application that uses [Jitsi Videobridge](https://jitsi.org/videobridge) to provide high quality, scalable video conferences. You can see [Jitsi Meet in action](http://youtu.be/7vFUVClsNh0) here at the 482 session of the VoIP Users Conference.

You can also try it out yourself at https://meet.jit.si .

Jitsi Meet allows for very efficient collaboration. It allows users to stream their desktop or only some windows. It also supports shared document editing with Etherpad and remote presentations with Prezi. 

## Install

Installing Jitsi Meet is quite a simple experience even though it requires installing a few other components first, such as Jitsi Videobridge, a web server such as Nginx and an XMPP one like Prosody.

You can find information on how to deploy Jitsi Meet in the [installation instructions](https://jitsi.org/meet/deploy)

You may also find it helpful to have a look at our sample [config files](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/tree/master/doc/example-config-files/) 

## Discuss
Please use the [Jitsi dev mailing list](http://lists.jitsi.org/pipermail/dev/) to discuss feature requests before opening an issue on github.
