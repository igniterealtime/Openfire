SIP Phone Plugin Readme
</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The SIP phone plugin lets you configure SIP phone support in Spark from the server. Spark clients
will read the SIP configuration from the server. Once configured Spark will let users make and
receive phone calls. From the admin console you can monitor the phone calls.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Copy the file, &quot;sip.jar&quot; into the plugins directory of your Openfire installation. The plugin will
then be automatically deployed. To upgrade to a new version just replace the &quot;sip.jar&quot; file with
the newest version or you can just update the plugin from the admin console in the plugins page.
</p>
<p>
If you are using Openfire Enterprise make sure that you are using Openfire Enterprise 3.4.0 or a latest
version. Otherwise this plugin might fail to load due to a conflict of XMPP services. Installations upgrading
to Openfire Enterprise 3.4.0 should execute the proper SQL migration script located in the <i>database/extras</i>
folder. The migration script will copy the SIP accounts registered in enterprise to this plugin.
</p>

<h2>Using the Plugin</h2>
<p>
Once the plugin has been installed you can log into the admin console to register SIP accounts for the
Spark users. Make sure that you have a SIP server and that Openfire can establish a connection to the machine
that is running the SIP server.
</p>
<p>
Log into the admin console and in the main page you will see the <b>SIP Settings</b> menu item. Go to that
page to configure the location of the SIP server. The next and last step is to register the SIP accounts
for the Spark users. Go to the <b>SIP Phone Mappings</b> menu item and enter the required information.
</p>
<p>
Once you have registered the SIP accounts for the Spark users you are ready to go. Make sure that Spark
has the SIP phone plugin installed. You can install the SIP phone plugin in Spark from the Spark --> Plugins
menu option.
