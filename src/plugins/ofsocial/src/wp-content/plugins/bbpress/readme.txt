bbPress is forum software, made the WordPress way.

== Description ==

Have you ever been frustrated with forum or bulletin board software that was slow, bloated and always got your server hacked? bbPress is focused on ease of integration, ease of use, web standards, and speed.

We're keeping things as small and light as possible while still allowing for great add-on features through WordPress's extensive plugin system. What does all that mean? bbPress is lean, mean, and ready to take on any job you throw at it.

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'
2. Search for 'bbPress'
3. Activate bbPress from your Plugins page. (You'll be greeted with a Welcome page.)
4. Visit 'Forums > Add New' and create some forums. (You can always delete these later.)
5a. If you have pretty permalinks enabled, visit yourdomain.com/forums.
5b. If you do not have pretty permalinks enabled, visit yourdomain.com?post_type=forum
