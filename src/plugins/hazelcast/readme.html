<h1>Hazelcast Clustering Plugin Readme</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Hazelcast plugin adds support for running multiple redundant Openfire
servers together in a cluster.  By running Openfire as a cluster, you can
distribute the connection load among several servers, while also providing
failover in the event that one of your servers fails. This plugin is a
drop-in replacement for the original Openfire clustering plugin, using the
open source <a href="http://www.hazelcast.com">Hazelcast</a> data distribution
framework in lieu of an expensive proprietary third-party product.
</p>
<p>
The current Hazelcast release is version 2.5.1.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
To create an Openfire cluster, you should have at least two Openfire servers,
and each server must have the Hazelcast plugin installed. To install Hazelcast, 
simply drop the hazelcast.jar into $OPENFIRE_HOME/plugins along with any other 
plugins you may have installed. You may also use the Plugins page from the 
admin console to install the plugin. Note that all servers in a given cluster 
must be configured to share a single external database (not the Embedded DB). 
</p>
<p>
By default during the Openfire startup/initialization process, the servers
will discover each other by exchanging UDP (multicast) packets via a configurable
IP address and port. However, be advised that many other initialization options 
are available and may be used if your network does not support multicast 
communication (see <a href="#config">Configuration</a> below).
</p>
<p>After the Hazelcast plugin has been deployed to each of the servers, use the 
radio button controls located on the Clustering page in the admin console to 
activate/enable the cluster. You only need to enable clustering once; the change 
will be propagated to the other servers automatically. After refreshing the 
Clustering page you will be able to see all the servers that have successfully 
joined the cluster.
</p>
<p>
Note that Hazelcast and the earlier clustering plugins (clustering.jar and enterprise.jar) 
are mutually exclusive. You will need to remove any existing older clustering plugin(s) 
before installing Hazelcast into your Openfire server(s).
</p>
<p>
With your cluster up and running, you will now want some form of load balancer to 
distribute the connection load among the members of your Openfire cluster. There 
are several commercial and open source alternatives for this. For example, 
if you are using the HTTP/BOSH Openfire connector to connect to Openfire, 
the Apache web server (httpd) plus the corresponding proxy balancer module
(<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy_balancer.html">mod_proxy_balancer</a>)
could provide a workable solution. Some other popular options include the
<a href="http://www.f5.com/products/big-ip/big-ip-local-traffic-manager/overview/">F5 LTM</a>
(commercial) and <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a> (open source), among
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_%28computing%29">many more</a>.
<p>
A simple round-robin DNS configuration can help distribute XMPP connections across multiple
Openfire servers in a cluster. While popular as a lightweight and low-cost way to provide
basic scalability, note that this approach is not considered adequate for true load balancing 
nor does it provide high availability (HA) from a client perspective. If you are evaluating 
these options, you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS">read more here</a>.

<h2>Upgrading the Hazelcast Plugin</h2>
<p>
The process of upgrading the Hazelcast plugin requires a few additional steps when
compared with a traditional plugin due to the cross-server dependencies within a running
cluster. Practically speaking, all the members of the cluster need to be running the
same version of the plugin to prevent various errors and data synchronization issues.
</p>
<h3>Option 1: Offline</h3>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This upgrade procedure is neat and tidy, but will incur a brief service outage.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Shut down Openfire on all servers in the cluster.</li>
<li>For the first server in the cluster, perform the following steps:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Remove the existing <code>plugins/hazelcast.jar</code></li>
<li>Remove (recursively) the <code>plugins/hazelcast</code> directory</li>
<li>Copy the updated <code>hazelcast.jar</code> into the <code>plugins</code> directory</li>
<li>Restart Openfire to unpack and install the updated plugin</li>
</ol>
<li>Repeat these steps for the remaining servers in the cluster.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Option 2: Online</h3> 
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Using this approach you should be able to continue servicing
XMPP connections during the upgrade.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Shut down Openfire on all servers <b>except one</b>.</li>
<li>Using the Plugins page from the online server, remove the existing Hazelcast plugin.</li>
<li>Upload the new Hazelcast plugin and confirm it is installed (refresh the page if necessary)</li>
<li>Use the "Offline" steps above to upgrade and restart the remaining servers.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Option 3: Split-Brain</h3> 
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Use this approach if you only have access to the Openfire console.
Note however that users may not be able to communicate with each other during the upgrade 
(if they are connected to different servers).
</p>
<ol>
<li>From the Clustering page in the Openfire admin console, disable clustering. This will disable
clustering for all members of the cluster.</li>
<li>For each server, update the Hazelcast plugin using the Plugins page.</li>
<li>After upgrading the plugin on all servers, use the Clustering page to enable clustering.
This will activate clustering for all members of the cluster.</li>
</ol>
<a name="config" />
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
There are several configuration options built into the Hazelcast plugin
as Openfire system properties:
<ol>
<li><i>hazelcast.startup.delay.seconds</i> (5): Number of seconds
to wait before launching the Hazelcast plugin. This allows Openfire to
deploy any other plugins before initializing the cluster caches, etc.</li>
<li><i>hazelcast.startup.retry.count</i> (1): Number of times to retry
initialization if the cluster fails to start on the first attempt.</li>
<li><i>hazelcast.startup.retry.seconds</i> (10): Number of seconds to wait
between subsequent attempts to start the cluster.</li>
<li><i>hazelcast.max.execution.seconds</i> (30): Maximum time to wait
when running a synchronous task across members of the cluster.</li>
<li><i>hazelcast.config.xml.filename</i> (hazelcast-cache-config.xml): Name
of the Hazelcast configuration file. By overriding this value you can easily
install a custom cache configuration file in the Hazelcast plugin /classes/
directory, in the directory named via the <i>hazelcast.config.xml.directory</i> 
property (described below), or in the classpath of your own custom plugin.</li>
<li><i>hazelcast.config.xml.directory</i> ({OPENFIRE_HOME}/conf): Directory
that will be added to the plugin's classpath. This allows a custom Hazelcast 
configuration file to be located outside the Openfire home directory.</li>
<li><i>hazelcast.config.jmx.enabled</i> (false): Enables JMX support for
the Hazelcast cluster if JMX has been enabled via the Openfire admin console. 
Refer to the <a href="http://www.hazelcast.com/docs/2.5/manual/multi_html/ch06.html">
Hazelcast JMX docs</a> for additional information.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The Hazelcast plugin uses the <a href="http://www.hazelcast.com/docs/2.5/manual/single_html/#Config">
XML configuration builder</a> to initialize the cluster from the XML file described above.
By default the cluster members will attempt to discover each other via multicast at the
following location:
<ul>
<li>IP Address: 224.2.2.3</li>
<li>Port: 54327</li>
</ul>
Note that these values can be overridden in the plugin's /classes/hazelcast-cache-config.xml
file (via the multicast-group and multicast-port elements). Many other initialization and
discovery options exist, as documented in the Hazelcast configuration docs noted above. For
example, to set up a two-node cluster using well-known DNS name/port values, try the
following alternative:
<pre>
...
&lt;join&gt;
    &lt;multicast enabled="false"/&gt;
    &lt;tcp-ip enabled="true"&gt;
      &lt;hostname&gt;of-node-a.example.com:5701&lt;/hostname&gt;
      &lt;hostname&gt;of-node-b.example.com:5701&lt;/hostname&gt;
    &lt;/tcp-ip&gt;
    &lt;aws enabled="false"/&gt;
&lt;/join&gt;
...
</pre>

Hazelcast reference manual</a> for more information.
