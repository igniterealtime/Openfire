 * ServerItemsProvider are responsible for providing the items associated with the SERVER. Example

 * <p>
 * When the server starts up, IQDiscoItemsHandler will request to all the services that implement
 * the ServerItemsProvider interface for their DiscoServerItems. Each DiscoServerItem will provide
 * its DiscoInfoProvider which will automatically be included in IQDiscoInfoHandler as the provider
 * for this item's JID. Moreover, each DiscoServerItem will also provide its DiscoItemsProvider
 * which will automatically be included in IQDiscoItemsHandler. Special attention must be paid to
 * the JID since all the items with the same host will share the same DiscoInfoProvider or
 * DiscoItemsProvider. Therefore, a service must implement this interface in order to get its
 * services published as items associatd with the server.</p>
