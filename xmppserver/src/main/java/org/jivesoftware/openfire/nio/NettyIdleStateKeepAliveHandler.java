/**
 * A NettyIdleStateKeepAliveHandler listens for IdleStateEvents triggered by an IdleStateHandler.
 *
 * When invoked, the existence of a flag on the ChannelHandlerContext is determined. If this flag does not exist, then
 * a keep-alive check if performed and the flag is set. If the does exist, then it is assumed that the peer failed the
 * keep-alive check and the connection should be closed.
 *
 * The keep-alive check is implemented as an XMPP ping request. XMPP entities must respond with either an IQ result or
 * an IQ error (feature-unavailable) stanza upon receiving the XMPP ping stanza. Both responses will be received by
 * Openfire. As any inbound data will cause the flag to be reset, the connection will no longer be deemed 'idle'.
 *
 * Entities that do not respond to the IQ Ping stanzas can be considered dead, and their connection will be closed when
 * the IdleStateHandler triggers the second idle event in a row.
 *
 * Note that whitespace pings that are sent by XMPP entities will also cause the connection idle count to be reset.
