 * Users may try to join a workgroup using clients with different capabilities. Therefore, the

 *
 * For instance, for sending notifications to a client that supports the
 * <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0142.html">Workgroup protocol</a> packets that
 * follow the specification will be used. On the other hand, if a user contacted the workgroup
 * using a standard XMPP client that does not have support for the Workgroup protocol, using
 * possibly a chatbot, then standard XMPP packets with no special extensions will be used.
