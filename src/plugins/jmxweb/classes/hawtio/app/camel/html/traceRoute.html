      <p>Tracing allows you to send messages to a route and then step through and see the messages flow through a route
        to aid debugging and to help diagnose issues.</p>

      <p>Once you start tracing, you can send messages to the input endpoints, then come back to this page and see the
        flow of messages through your route.</p>

      <p>As you click on the message table, you can see which node in the flow it came through; moving the selection up and down in the message table lets you see the flow of the message through the diagram.</p>
