Some of the files here, notably libjitsi.jar, are OSGi bundles from the Jitsi
project. In Jitsi they are generated in the 'sc-bundles' directory by the
'bundles' ant target. To update the files here, run 'ant rebuild' in Jitsi and
then copy the files here, e.g.:

for f in *.jar; do
  if [ -e ../../jitsi/sc-bundles/$f ]; then
    cp ../../jitsi/sc-bundles/$f .; 
  fi;
done
