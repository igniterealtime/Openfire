  "readme": "# Tinycon\n\nA small library for manipulating the favicon, in particular adding alert bubbles and changing images. Tinycon gracefully falls back to a number in title approach for browers that don't support canvas or dynamic favicons.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/tommoor/tinycon/blob/master/examples/screenshot.png?raw=true\" />\n\n<a href=\"http://tommoor.github.com/tinycon/\">See the Live Demo here.</a>\n\n## Documentation\n\nTinycon adds a single object to the global namespace and does not require initialisation. \n\n### Basic Usage\n\n        Tinycon.setBubble(6);\n\n### Options\n\nTinycon can take a range of options to customise the look\n\n* width: the width of the alert bubble\n* height: the height of the alert bubble\n* font: a css string to use for the fontface (recommended to leave this)\n* colour: the foreground font colour\n* background: the alert bubble background colour\n* fallback: should we fallback to a number in brackets for browsers that don't support canvas/dynamic favicons? Boolean, or use the string 'force' to ensure a title update even in supported browsers. \n\n        Tinycon.setOptions({\n          \twidth: 7,\n\t\t\theight: 9,\n\t\t\tfont: '10px arial',\n\t\t\tcolour: '#ffffff',\n\t\t\tbackground: '#549A2F',\n\t\t\tfallback: true\n        });\n\n## Browser Support\n\nTinycon has been tested to work completely in the following browsers. Older versions may be supported, but haven't been tested:\n\n* Chrome 15+\n* Firefox 9+\n* Opera 11+\n\nCurrently the library degrades to title update:\n\n* Internet Explorer 9\n* Safari 5\n\n\n## License / Credits\n\nTinycon is released under the MIT license. It is simple and easy to understand and places almost no restrictions on what you can do with Tinycon.\n[More Information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)\n\nTinycon was inspired by [Notificon](https://github.com/makeable/Notificon)\n\n\n## Download\n\nReleases are available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/tommoor/tinycon/downloads).\n",
