        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            Openfire is a powerful instant messaging (IM) and chat server that implements the XMPP protocol. This
            document will guide  you through installing Openfire. For a full list of features and more information,
            please visit the Openfire website:
            <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/" target="_top">https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Openfire installers do not contain a bundled Java runtime (JRE). Therefore, you must have a
            JDK or JRE installed on your system. Openfire 4.3 (also 4.2 and older versions) requires Java 8. Starting
            with 4.4 version Openfire also supports Java 11. Openfire 4.8 and later require Java 11 and no longer run
            with older versions of Java. Openfire 4.10 requires Java 17. You can check your java version by typing
            <code>java -version</code> at the command line.
        </p>

        <p>To complete the installation of Openfire, you'll need to perform each of the following steps:</p>

        <h2>Installation</h2>

        <section id="installation-windows">

            <h3>Windows</h3>

            <p>
                Select Openfire installer that is better suiting you (x86 or x64). Run the installer. The application
                will be installed to <code>C:\Program Files\Openfire</code> by default.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> On Windows systems we suggest using a service to run Openfire (read the Windows Service
                section below). When using Openfire Launcher on Windows Vista or newer with UAC protection enabled, it
                has to be run with Run as administrator option, to be able to write changes to config and embedded
                database (if used) stored in <code>C:\Program files\Openfire\</code> folder. If Openfire is running via
                the launcher without the 'Run as administrator' option from Program files, it can't get proper
                permissions to write changes. It shows errors (in red) when running the launcher and during the setup
                will require the current password for the administrator account (although this is a new installation.
                Normally it doesn't ask for it). This is an effect of missing permissions and Openfire not being able to
                initialize the database and other resources.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>
                    Since 4.1.5 Openfire installs and runs the service automatically (also opens the browser and loads
                    the web setup page). The launcher (if one wants to use it) is also made to run in elevated mode, so
                    one don't need to run it as administrator manually. But you shouldn't use the launcher, if the
                    service is running. Because this will create a conflict.

            <p>
                Openfire can store its data in an embedded database or you can choose to use an external database such
                as MySQL or Oracle. If you would like to use an external database, you must prepare it before proceeding
                with installation. View the <a href="database.html">database setup</a> documentation for more information.

        </section>

        <section id="config">

            <h3>Setup the Server</h3>

            <p>
                A web-based, "wizard" driven setup and configuration tool is built into Openfire. Simply launch Openfire
                (platform-specific instructions below) and use a web browser to connect to the admin console. The
                default port for the web-based admin console is 9090. If you are on the same machine as Openfire, the
                following URL will usually work: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:9090">http://127.0.0.1:9090</a>. Windows
                Server administrators might need to add the http://127.0.0.1 address to browser's Trusted Sites list, if
                Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled, to prevent getting a blank screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a security measure, the Openfire administration console is by default, only accessible from the server
                itself ("localhost"). Openfire can be reconfigured to also allow this to become accessible from a remote
                computer using LAN IP address instead or hostname if it is resolvable by the remote computer. To do so,
                modify the <code>openfire.xml</code> configuration file, and remove the line that holds the
                <code>interface</code> definition (or adjust it to an appropriate interface definition).
            </p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>Admin console interface definition snippet of openfire.xml</legend>
                <pre><code>&lt;jive&gt;
  &lt;adminConsole&gt;
    &lt;!-- Disable either port by setting the value to -1 --&gt;
    &lt;port&gt;9090&lt;/port&gt;
    &lt;securePort&gt;9091&lt;/securePort&gt;
    &lt;interface&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/interface&gt;
  &lt;/adminConsole&gt;</code></pre>
            </fieldset>

            <p>
                After initial setup has been performed, access lists based on IP addresses and ranges can be configured
                for fine-grained control of access to the Admin Console. This configuration can be found on the page
                called "Admin Console Access" (under the "Server" / "Server Manager" tab).

            <h3 id="autosetup">Autosetup</h3>

            <p>
                As an alternative to the web-based "wizard" driven setup described above, Openfire can be configured by
                provisioning it with a specially crafted <code>openfire.xml</code> file.
            </p>

            <p>
                If <code>&lt;setup&gt;true&lt;>/setup&gt;</code> does not exist in <code>openfire.xml</code> (i.e. setup is not
                complete), and a block <em>does</em> exist called <code>&lt;autosetup&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;run&gt;true&lt;/run&gt;</code>
                property inside it, that looks like this:
            </p>

                <legend>Example autosetup configuration in openfire.xml</legend>

            &lt;domain&gt;localhost&lt;/domain&gt;
            &lt;fqdn&gt;localhost&lt;/fqdn&gt;
            &lt;auth&gt;
                &lt;anonymous&gt;true&lt;/anonymous&gt;
            &lt;/auth&gt;
            &lt;socket&gt;
                &lt;ssl&gt;
                    &lt;active&gt;true&lt;/active&gt;
                &lt;/ssl&gt;
            &lt;/socket&gt;
        &lt;/xmpp&gt;

        &lt;admin&gt;
            &lt;email&gt;admin@example.com&lt;/email&gt;

            </fieldset>

            <p>
                Then setup will be run on first launch, and the <code>&lt;autosetup/&gt;</code> section will be deleted from
                <code>openfire.xml</code>
            </p>

            <p>

            <h3>Admin Console</h3>

            <p>
                After completing the above steps, Openfire will be configured through, and you can use the web-based admin
                console to administer the server. The URL should be the same as you used to setup the server unless you
                changed the port during the setup.

        <h2>Running Openfire on Windows</h2>

        <p>
            Since 4.1.5 version Openfire automatically installs and runs the service (and opens the browser with the web
            setup page). But you can also use the launcher, if you need to (service has to be stopped before running the
            launcher). If you used the Openfire installer, a shortcut for starting the graphical launcher is provided in
            your Start Menu. Otherwise, run openfire.exe in the <code>bin/</code> directory of your Openfire
            installation. A button on the launcher allows you to automatically open your web browser to the correct URL
            to finish setting up the server: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:9090">http://127.0.0.1:9090</a>
        </p>

        <section>

            <h3>Windows Service</h3>

            <figure class="inline-right">
                <img src="images/windows_service.png" alt="Windows Service">
                <figcaption>Windows Service commands in a console windows.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                As of 4.1.5 Openfire installs the service automatically. But if you are using older version or want to
                reinstall the service, you can use the <code>openfire-service.exe</code> executable in the
                <code>bin</code> directory of the installation to install or uninstall the service.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a console window, you can run the following commands:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt><code>openfire-service /install</code></dt>
                <dd>installs the service.</dd>

                <dt><code>openfire-service /uninstall</code></dt>
                <dd>uninstalls the service.</dd>

                <dt><code>openfire-service /start</code></dt>
                <dd>starts the service</dd>

                <dt><code>openfire-service /stop</code></dt>
                <dd>stops the service.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                You can also use the Services tool in the Windows Control Panel to start and stop the service.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> the graphical launcher is not compatible with the Windows service. If you install the
                service, you should use service controls as described above to control the server rather than the
                graphical launcher.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Upgrading Note:</b> you should stop Openfire service before running the installer to upgrade to the
                newer version. Starting with 4.1.5 version Openfire will automatically stop and reinstall the service
                when upgrading with the installer.
            </p>

            <h3>Custom Parameters</h3>

            <p>
                Advanced users may wish to pass in parameters to the Java virtual machine (VM) to customize the runtime
                environment of Openfire. You can do this by creating a <code>openfire.vmoptions</code> file in the
                <code>bin/</code> directory of your Openfire installation. For the Windows service, you'd create a new
                text file called <code>openfire-service.vmoptions</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each parameter to the VM should be on a new line of the file. For example, to set the minimum heap size
                to 512 MB and max VM heap size to 1024 MB, you'd use:
            </p>

            <pre><code>-Xms512m
-Xmx1024m</code></pre>

            <p>
                To create parameters for the normal launcher, create a file called <code>openfired.vmoptions</code>
                (since the openfire.exe launcher invokes the openfired.exe executable to actually start the server).

        <h2>Running Openfire in Linux/Unix</h2>

        <p>
            If you are running on a Red Hat or Red Hat like system (CentOS, Fedora, etc.), we recommend using the RPM
            distributable, as it contains some custom handling of the standard Red Hat like environment. Assuming that
            you have used the RPM, you can start and stop Openfire using the <code>/etc/init.d/openfire</code> script.
        </p>
        <pre><code># /etc/init.d/openfire
Usage /etc/init.d/openfire {start|stop|restart|status|condrestart|reload}
# /etc/init.d/openfire start
Starting openfire:</code></pre>
        <p>
            If you are running on a different Linux/Unix variant, and/or you have used the .tar.gz 'installer', you can
            start and stop Openfire using the <code>bin/openfire</code> script in your Openfire installation:
        </p>
        <pre><code># ./openfire

Usage: ./openfire {start|stop}
# ./openfire start
Starting openfire</code></pre>
        <p>
            If you would like to install Openfire as a service, two scripts are provided in the <code>bin/extra</code>
            directory:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>redhat-postinstall.sh</code> -- automatically installs Openfire as a service on Red Hat. It does so by creating a "jive" user and then copying the openfired script to your init.d directory. This script must be run as root. Please see the comments in the script for additional information.</li>
            <li><code>openfired</code> -- script to run Openfire as a service. You must manually configure this script. See the comments in  the script for additional details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>
                It is not recommended that you use either of these scripts if you installed via RPM. The RPM has already
                taken care of what these scripts take care of.
            </b>

            <h3>Custom Parameters</h3>

            <p>
                Advanced users may wish to pass in parameters to the Java virtual machine (VM) to customize the runtime
                environment of Openfire. If you installed via RPM, you can customize this by editing
                <code>/etc/sysconfig/openfire</code> and looking at the OPENFIRE_OPTS option. If you installed via
                .tar.gz, you will need to tweak your startup script to fit your needs.

        <h2>Plugins</h2>

        <p>
            Plugins add additional features and protocol support to Openfire. After setting up your Openfire
            installation, you may want to download and install plugins to enhance your server. Plugins can be downloaded
            from the <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins.jsp">plugins page</a> on
            igniterealtime.org or directly inside the administration console.
        </p>

        <section>

            <h3>Installing Plugins</h3>

            <p>
                If you download a plugin from inside the Openfire administration console, it will automatically
                be installed. If you manually download the plugin (packaged as a .jar file), you can deploy it
                by copying the plugin file to the <code>plugins/</code> directory of your Openfire installation. A
                plugin monitor will automatically extract the plugin into a directory and install the plugin in Openfire.
                You may also use the "upload plugin" feature in the admin console (under the Plugins tab) to load
                a plugin from your local file system to the server.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> For nearly all plugins, a restart of the Openfire server software is not required.
                You should be able to install and remove plugins on-demand without impacting Openfire.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section>

            <h3>Managing Plugins</h3>

            <p>
                Plugins can be managed inside the Openfire admin console. You can also manually delete a plugin at any
                time by deleting its JAR file (Openfire will automatically remove the plugin from memory and delete its
                directory when you do so).

        <h2>Firewall</h2>

        <p>
            Server's administrator should open TCP ports <code>5222</code> and <code>5223</code> for incoming
            connections for XMPP clients to be able to connect to Openfire.
        </p>
        <p>
            For secure BOSH / (HTTP-bind) and websocket-based client connections ensure that TCP port <code>7443</code>
            is reachable. The unencrypted port equivalent for this port (which uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, or WS instead
            of WSS) is <code>7070</code>. We recommend only using encrypted connections on port <code>7443</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For server to server connections one should also open ports TCP <code>5269</code> and <code>5270</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a general rule, the Openfire Admin Console should not be exposed to the general internet. However, an
            administrator can choose to open TCP <code>9090</code> (for HTTP) and TCP <code>9091</code> (for HTTPS), if
            there is a need to remotely administrate Openfire connecting to its Admin Console. We recommend only using
            <code>9091</code> port as it is an encrypted connection, and we strongly recommend limiting access to a
            curated list of known, trusted network addresses, if any.
        </p>
        <p>
            Port number can be different, if the default configuration has been changed by an administrator. Additional
            ports may also be in use by Openfire or by plugins to provide additional features. The full list of ports
            used by Openfire can be found on the first page of Admin Console in the Server Ports section.
