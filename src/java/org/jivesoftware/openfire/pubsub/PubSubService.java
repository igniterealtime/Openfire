 * A PubSubService is responsible for keeping the hosted nodes by the service, the default

 * node management.<p>
 *
 * Implementations of PubSubService are expected to collaborate with a {@link PubSubEngine}
 * that will take care of handling packets sent to the service.<p>

 * The separation between <code>PubSubService</code> and <code>PubSubEngine</code> allows to
 * reuse the handling of packets and at the same time be able to create different pubsub
 * services with different configurations. Examples of different pubsub services are:
 * JEP-60: Publish-Subscribe and JEP-163: Personal Eventing Protocol.
