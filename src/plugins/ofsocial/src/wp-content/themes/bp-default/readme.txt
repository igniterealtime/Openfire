--- BuddyPress Default ---
Clean and stylish, BuddyPress Default lets you build a social network straight out of the box. Make it yours with a custom menu, header image, and background. Along with five widgetized areas (one in the sidebar, four in the footer), BP-Default supports featured images (as custom header images on posts and pages) and is furnished with an optional one-column page template that removes the sidebar, and a stylesheet for the admin Visual Editor.


--- Installation ---
The theme is bundled with BuddyPress. After activating the plugin, BuddyPress Default will be added to the "Appearance > Themes" menu in your WordPress admin area.

Social networking in a box. Build a social network for your company, school, sports team or niche community all based on the power and flexibility of WordPress.

--- Building a BuddyPress theme ---
If you want to make a custom theme based on BuddyPress Default, DO NOT copy and edit it. By doing this you will make updates and maintenance much harder for yourself. Instead, please review this codex page for instructions on how to build a BuddyPress child theme:
