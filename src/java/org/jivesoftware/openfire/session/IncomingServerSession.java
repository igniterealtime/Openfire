/**
 * Server-to-server communication is done using two TCP connections between the servers. One
 * connection is used for sending packets while the other connection is used for receiving packets.
 * The <tt>IncomingServerSession</tt> represents the connection to a remote server that will only
 * be used for receiving packets.<p>
 *
 * Currently only the Server Dialback method is being used for authenticating the remote server.
 * Once the remote server has been authenticated incoming packets will be processed by this server.
 * It is also possible for remote servers to authenticate more domains once the session has been
 * established. For optimization reasons the existing connection is used between the servers.
 * Therefore, the incoming server session holds the list of authenticated domains which are allowed
 * to send packets to this server.<p>
 *
 * Using the Server Dialback method it is possible that this server may also act as the
 * Authoritative Server. This implies that an incoming connection will be established with this
 * server for authenticating a domain. This incoming connection will only last for a brief moment
 * and after the domain has been authenticated the connection will be closed and no session will
 * exist.
