/**
 * Route packets to other nodes of the cluster. If the remote node was not found or failed
 * to be reached then depending on the type of packet an error packet will be returned. In case
 * the remote node is reached but the remote node fails to route the packet to the recipient (e.g.
 * the receipient just left) then an error packet may be created from the remote node and send it
 * back to this node.<p>
 * 
 * TODO For optimization reasons, this class instead of sending an InvocationService for each
 * packet to route to a remote node may use a smarter logic that would group a few packets into
 * a single InvocationService thus reducing network traffic. Moreover, bnux can be used as a way
 * to encode packets to send so that XML parsing is optimized on the other side.
