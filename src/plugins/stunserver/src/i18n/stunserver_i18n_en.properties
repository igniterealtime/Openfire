stun.settings.desc = STUN is a protocol that lets clients discover their network settings, \
  including firewall and NAT device configuration. Use of the protocol is required for clients \
  to establish peer to peer media sessions. The server can be configured as a STUN service itself, or it \
  can send third-party STUN server addresses to clients.<br/><br/> \

  same machine are required, as well as two different port numbers for each IP.
