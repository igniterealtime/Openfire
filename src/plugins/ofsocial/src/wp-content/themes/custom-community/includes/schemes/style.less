Custom Community 2, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

This theme is developed on the _tk starter theme:
http://themekraft.com/tk-wordpress-bootstrap-starter-theme/
_tk is an ultra minimal starter theme based on Twitter Bootstrap Framework and
the _s starter theme from Automattic, the guys behind WordPress.

If you like to customize inside your CSS files directly,
you should consider to create a child theme instead of changing theme files - this would break your updates.
