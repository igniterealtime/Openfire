/**
 * General purpose cache. It stores objects associated with unique keys in
 * memory for fast access. All keys and values added to the cache must
 * implement the Serializable interface. Values may implement the Cacheable
 * interface, which allows the cache to determine object size much more quickly.
 * These restrictions allow a cache to never grow larger than a specified number
 * of bytes and to optionally be distributed over a cluster of servers.<p>
 *
 * If the cache does grow too large, objects will be removed such that those
 * that are accessed least frequently are removed first. Because expiration
 * happens automatically, the cache makes <b>no</b> guarantee as to how long
 * an object will remain in cache after it is put in.<p>
 *
 * Optionally, a maximum lifetime for all objects can be specified. In that
 * case, objects will be deleted from cache after that amount of time, even
 * if they are frequently accessed. This feature is useful if objects put in
 * cache represent data that should be periodically refreshed; for example,
 * information from a database.<p>
 *
 * All cache operations are thread safe.<p>
 *
 * Note that neither keys or values can be null; A {@link NullPointerException}
 * will be thrown attempting to place or retrieve null values in to the cache.
