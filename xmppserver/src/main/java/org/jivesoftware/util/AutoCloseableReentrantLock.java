/**
 * A {@link ReentrantLock} lock that can be unlocked using an {@link AutoCloseable}. This allows for easy locking of
 * resources, using a specific class as a namespace. Typical usage:
 * <pre>
 *     try (final AutoCloseableReentrantLock.AutoCloseableLock ignored = new AutoCloseableReentrantLock(Clazz.class, user.getUsername()).lock()) {
 *         user.performNonThreadSafeTask();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This essentially has the same effect as:
 * <pre>
 *     synchronised ((Clazz.class.getName() + user.getUsername()).intern()) {
 *         user.performNonThreadSafeTask();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * but has advantages in that the current status of the lock can interrogated, the lock can be acquired interruptibly, etc.
