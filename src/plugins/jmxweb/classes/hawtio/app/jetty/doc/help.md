### Jetty

This plugin works with Jetty to manage the deployed applications, as well viewing information about connectors, and JMX, etc.

The plugin has sub tabs that allows you to see among others the following details:

* Server - Information such as the Jetty version
* Applications - Lists all deployed web applications
* Connectors - Lists all external connectors such as HTTP/HTTPs listeners
* JMX - Gives access to the Jetty MBeans

The Applications sub tab lists all the web applications deployed in Jetty. The lifecycle of the application(s) can
be controlled using the buttons bar, such as restarting or stopping the applications.

A screen shot of the application tab is shown below
