Pure JavaScript and native libpq bindings.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install pg\n    \n## Examples\n\n### Callbacks\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg'); \n//or native libpq bindings\n//var pg = require('pg').native\n\nvar conString = \"tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n\n//note: error handling omitted\nvar client = new pg.Client(conString);\nclient.connect(function(err) {\n  client.query('SELECT NOW() AS \"theTime\"', function(err, result) {\n      console.log(result.rows[0].theTime);\n      //output: Tue Jan 15 2013 19:12:47 GMT-600 (CST)\n  })\n});\n\n```\n\n### Events\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg'); //native libpq bindings = `var pg = require('pg').native`\nvar conString = \"tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n\nvar client = new pg.Client(conString);\nclient.connect();\n\n//queries are queued and executed one after another once the connection becomes available\nclient.query(\"CREATE TEMP TABLE beatles(name varchar(10), height integer, birthday timestamptz)\");\nclient.query(\"INSERT INTO beatles(name, height, birthday) values($1, $2, $3)\", ['John', 68, new Date(1944, 10, 13)]);\nvar query = client.query(\"SELECT * FROM beatles WHERE name = $1\", ['John']);\n\n//can stream row results back 1 at a time\nquery.on('row', function(row) {\n  console.log(row);\n  console.log(\"Beatle name: %s\", row.name); //Beatle name: John\n  console.log(\"Beatle birth year: %d\", row.birthday.getYear()); //dates are returned as javascript dates\n  console.log(\"Beatle height: %d' %d\\\"\", Math.floor(row.height/12), row.height%12); //integers are returned as javascript ints\n});\n\n//fired after last row is emitted\nquery.on('end', function() { \n  client.end();\n});\n```\n\n### Example notes\n\nnode-postgres supports both an 'event emitter' style API and a 'callback' style.  The callback style is more concise and generally preferred, but the evented API can come in handy when you want to handle row events as they come in.  \n\nThey can be mixed and matched.  The only events which do __not__ fire when callbacks are supplied are the `error` events, as they are to be handled within the callback function.\n\nAll examples will work with the pure javascript bindings or the libpq native (c/c++) bindings\n\nTo use native libpq bindings replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.\n\nThe two share the same interface so __no other code changes should be required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `pg` to `pg.native`, please report an issue.\n\n### Features\n\n* pure javascript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_\n* row-by-row result streaming\n* responsive project maintainer\n* supported PostgreSQL features\n  * parameterized queries\n  * named statements with query plan caching\n  * async notifications with `LISTEN/NOTIFY`\n  * bulk import & export with `COPY TO/COPY FROM`\n  * extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion\n\n## Heads Up!!\n\nnode-postgres is __very__ near to v1.0.0 release.  Up until now I've tried to maintain all backwards compatilbity, but there are a few breaking changes the community has recommended I introduce.\n\nThe current version will spit out deprecation warnings when you use the soon-to-be-deprecated features.  They're meant to be obtrusive and annoying.  Understandable if you'd like to disable them.\n\nYou can do so like this: `pg.defaults.hideDeprecationWarnings = true;`\n\nThese are the breaking changes: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/pull/301\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is a work in progress primarily taking place on the github WIKI\n\n### [Documentation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki)\n\n### __PLEASE__ check out the WIKI\n\nIf you have a question, post it to the FAQ section of the WIKI so everyone can read the answer\n\n## Production Use\n* [yammer.com](http://www.yammer.com)\n* [bayt.com](http://bayt.com)\n* [bitfloor.com](https://bitfloor.com)\n* [Vendly](http://www.vend.ly)\n* [SaferAging](http://www.saferaging.com)\n\n_if you use node-postgres in production and would like your site listed here, fork & add it_\n\n## Contributing\n\n__I love contributions.__\n\nYou are welcome contribute via pull requests.  If you need help getting the tests running locally feel free to email me or gchat me.\n\nI will __happily__ accept your pull request if it:\n- _has tests_\n- looks reasonable\n- does not break backwards compatibility\n- satisfies jshint\n\nInformation about the testing processes is in the [wiki](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Testing).\n\nIf you need help or have questions about constructing a pull request I'll be glad to help out as well.\n\n## Support\n\nIf at all possible when you open an issue please provide\n- version of node\n- version of postgres\n- smallest possible snippet of code to reproduce the problem\n\nUsually I'll pop the code into the repo as a test.  Hopefully the test fails.  Then I make the test pass.  Then everyone's happy!\n\n\nIf you need help or run into _any_ issues getting node-postgres to work on your system please report a bug or contact me directly.  I am usually available via google-talk at my github account public email address.\n\nI usually tweet about any important status updates or changes to node-postgres.  You can follow me [@briancarlson](https://twitter.com/briancarlson) to keep up to date.\n\n\n## Extras\n\nnode-postgres is by design _low level_ with the bare minimum of abstraction.
