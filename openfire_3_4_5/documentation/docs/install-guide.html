<p>Openfire is a powerful instant messaging (IM) and chat
server that implements the XMPP protocol. This document will guide 
you through installing Openfire. For a full list of features and more information, please
visit the Openfire website: <a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/"
 target="_top">http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Windows</h3>
Run the Openfire installer. The application will be installed to <tt>c:\Program Files\Openfire</tt> by default.
 
 <h3>Linux/Unix</h3>
 
 Choose either the RPM or tar.gz build. If using the RPM, run it using your package manager to install Openfire to <tt>/opt/openfire</tt>:

 <p><tt>rpm -ivh openfire_3_0_0.rpm</tt></p>

 
 If using the .tar.gz, extract the archive to <tt>/opt</tt> or <tt>/usr/bin</tt>:

 <p><tt>tar -xzvf openfire_3_0_0.tar.gz<br>
 mv openfire /opt</tt></p>

 <p><b>Note:</b> the .tar.gz build does not contain a bundled Java runtime (JRE). Therefore, you must have JDK or JRE 1.5.0 (Java 5) or later installed on your system. You can check your java version by typing "java -version" at the command line and (if necessary) upgrade your Java installation by visiting http://java.sun.com.</p>

  </ul>
<h2>Setup Overview</h2>
<p>To complete the installation of Openfire, you'll need to
perform each of the following steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#database">Database</a> - if you choose to use an external database, you must
 prepare your database for Openfire. </li>
  <li><a href="#config">Setup</a> - Use the built-in web-based setup
tool to setup and verify the server configuration.</li>

  <li><a href="#tools">Admin Console</a> - use the web-based admin tool to
manage the server.</li>
</ol>

<p>This document also includes information on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#windows">Running under Windows</a>
    <li><a href="#unix">Running under Unix/Linux</a>

    <li><a href="#plugins">Installing and using plugins</a>
</ul>

<h2><a name="distribution">Files in the Distribution</a></h2>
<p> The files in your distribution should be as follows (some
sub-directories omitted for brevity): </p>
<pre>openfire/
 |- readme.html
 |- license.html
 |- conf/
 |- bin/
 |- jre/
 |- lib/
 |- plugins/
     |- admin/
 |- resources/
     |-database/
     |-security/
 |- documentation/</pre>

<ul> 
	 <li>The <tt>conf</tt> directory is where Openfire stores
configuration files.</li>

  <li>The <tt>bin</tt> directory contains the server executables. Depending
on which distribution you installed, different executables will be available.</li>
  <li>The <tt>jre</tt> directory contains a Java 5 runtime that is bundled with the Windows and RPM versions of Openfire.</li>
  <li>The <tt>lib</tt> directory contains libraries necessary for
running Openfire.</li>

  <li>The <tt>plugins</tt> directory contains server plugins. By
default, Openfire ships with a web-based admin console plugin.</li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/database</tt> directory contains SQL schema files to
create new Openfire databases, as well as upgrade scripts for
existing installations. </li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/security</tt> directory is where Openfire
maintains keystores to support SSL connection security.</li>

  <li>The <tt>documentation</tt> directory contains server
documentation.</li>
</ul><p>

<h2><a name="database">Setup the Database</a></h2>
<p>Openfire can store its data in an embedded database or you can choose to use
an external database such as MySQL or Oracle. If you would like to use an external database,
you must prepare it before proceeding with installation. View the <a href="database.html">database
setup</a> documentation for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="config"></a>Setup the Server</h2>
<p>A web-based, "wizard" driven setup and configuration tool is built
into Openfire. Simply launch Openfire (platform-specific instructions below) and use a web browser to
connect to the admin console. The default port for the
web-based admin console is 9090. If you are on the same machine as Openfire, the
following URL will usually work: 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:9090">http://127.0.0.1:9090</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="tools">Admin Console</a></h2>
<p>After completing the above steps, Openfire will be configured
and you can use the web-based admin console to administer
the server. The URL should be the same as you used to setup the server
unless you changed the port during the setup.<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="windows">Running Openfire in Windows</a></h2>

<p>If you used the Openfire installer, a shortcut for starting the
a graphical launcher is provided in your Start Menu. Otherwise, run openfire.exe in the <tt>bin/</tt> directory of your
Openfire installation. A button on the on the launcher allows
you to automatically open your web browser to the correct URL to finish 
setting up the server: 

<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/launcher.png" alt="Openfire Launcher" width="400" height="300" align="center">
</div>
</p>

<h3>Windows Service</h3>
<p>If you're running Openfire on Windows, you will likely want to
run Openfire as a standard Windows service after initial setup.
If you used the Windows installer, a <tt>openfire-service.exe</tt> file
will be in the <tt>bin</tt> directory of the installation. You can use
this executable to install and control the Openfire service.

</p>

From a console window, you can run the following commands:
<ul>
		<li><tt>openfire-service /install</tt> -- installs the service.
		<li><tt>openfire-service /uninstall</tt> -- uninstalls the service.
		<li><tt>openfire-service /start</tt> -- starts the service
		<li><tt>openfire-service /stop</tt> -- stops the service.

</ul>

<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/windows_service.png" alt="Windows Service" width="557" height="223" align="center">
</div>
</p>

<p>You can also use the Services tool in the Windows Control Panel to start and
stop the service.</p>

<p>Note: the graphical launcher is not compatible with the Windows service
at this time. If you install the service, you should use service controls
as described above to control the server rather than the graphical launcher.</p>

<h3>Custom Parameters</h3>

<p>Advanced users may wish to pass in parameters to the Java virtual machine (VM) to customize
    the runtime environment of Openfire. You can do this by creating vmoptions files in the bin/
    directory of your Openfire installation. For the Windows service, you'd create a new text
    file called openfire-service.vmoptions. Each parameter to the VM should be on a new line of
    the file. For example, to set the minimum heap size to 512 MB and max VM heap size to 1024 MB, you'd use:

<pre>-Xms512m
-Xmx1024m</pre>

To create parameters for the normal launcher, create a file called openfired.vmoptions (since
    the openfire.exe launcher invokes the openfired.exe executable to actually start the server).</p>

<h2><a name="unix">Running Openfire in Linux/Unix</a></h2>

If you are running on a Red Hat or Red Hat like system (CentOS, Fedora, etc), we recommend using the
RPM as it contains some custom handling of the standard Red Hat like environment.  Assuming that you
have used the RPM, you can start and stop Openfire using the <tt>/etc/init.d/openfire</tt> script.

<p>
<tt>
# /etc/init.d/openfire<br>
Usage /etc/init.d/openfire {start|stop|restart|status|condrestart|reload}<br>
# /etc/init.d/openfire start<br>
Starting openfire:
</tt>
</p>


If you are running on a different Linux/Unix varient, and/or you have used the .tar.gz 'installer',
you can start and stop Openfire using the <tt>bin/openfire</tt> script in your Openfire installation:

<p>
<tt>
# ./openfire<br>

Usage: ./openfire {start|stop}<br>
# ./openfire start<br>
Starting openfire
</tt></p>

If you would like to install Openfire as a service, two scripts are provided in the <tt>bin/extra</tt>
directory:
<ul>
    <li>redhat-postinstall.sh --   automatically installs Openfire as a service on Red Hat. It does so by creating a "jive" user and then copying the openfired script to your init.d directory. This script must be run as root. Please see the comments in the script for additional information.</li>
    <li>openfired -- script to run Openfire as a service. You must manually configure this script. See the comments in
the script for additional details.</li>
</ul>
<b>It is not recommended that you use either of these scripts if you installed via RPM.  The RPM has already taken care of what these scripts take care of.</b>

<h3>Custom Parameters</h3>

<p>Advanced users may wish to pass in parameters to the Java virtual machine (VM) to customize
    the runtime environment of Openfire. If you installed via RPM, you can customize this by
    editing /etc/sysconfig/openfire and looking at the OPENFIRE_OPTS option.  If you installed
    via .tar.gz, you will need to tweak your startup script to fit your needs.</p>

<h2><a name="plugins">Plugins</a></h2>

Plugins add additional features and protocol support to Openfire. After setting up your
Openfire installation, you may want to download and install plugins to enhance your
server. Plugins can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins.jsp">plugins page</a> on igniterealtime.org
or directly inside the administration console.

<h3>Installing Plugins</h3>

If you download a plugin from inside the Openfire administration console, it will automatically
be installed. If you manually download the plugin (packaged as a .jar file), you can deploy it
by copying the plugin file to the <tt>plugins/</tt> directory of your Openfire installation. A
plugin monitor will automatically extract the plugin into a directory and install the plugin in Openfire.
You may also use the "upload plugin" feature in the admin console (under the Plugins tab) to load
a plugin from your local file system to the server.


<h3>Managing Plugins</h3>

Plugins can be managed inside the Openfire admin console. You can also manually delete a plugin at any time by
deleting its JAR file (Openfire will automatically remove the plugin from memory and delete it's directory when you
do so).
