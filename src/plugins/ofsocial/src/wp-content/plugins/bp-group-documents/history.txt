Version 0.4.3.1 (May 5, 2012)
- This update by Keeble Smith Ltd (http://keeblesmith.com) - thanks to Lena Stergatu for adopting (stergatu@cti.gr)
- *** Please Note:
- *** This update includes a complete rewrite of style.css to allow themes to override correctly, simplify, create clearer element identification and remove obsolete css
- *** You may need to update any css overrides you are implementing
- *** This update also includes major changes to the form layout and other HTML elements which may cause require additional css changes, but should allow future updates to be more stable
- Added BP_GROUP_DOCUMENTS_ALLOW_WP_EDITOR default setting (false)
- Added conditional use of wp_editor, based on BP_GROUP_DOCUMENTS_ALLOW_WP_EDITOR setting (to provide theme authors with some control - ideally should be a setting.
- Added logical check of BP_GROUP_DOCUMENTS_ALLOW_WP_EDITOR so description is stored correctly either way
- Added logical check of BP_GROUP_DOCUMENTS_ALLOW_WP_EDITOR in do_post_logic for description property population in add and edit contexts
- Updated get_file_size to test file_exists, avoiding warning messages being written to the error_log
- Fixed category filter disappears if no documents exist in the selected category, making it impossible to then change the filter back and see any documents.
- Multiple changes to the form layout and styling - simpler, cleaner HTML and CSS which now validates and is compatible with more themes:
-- Moved Document List heading so it will appear even if there are no documents to show
-- Updated document description display to use stripslashes if using wp_editor and nl2br if not
-- Updated bp-group-documents-delete to a class instead of ID (avoiding duplicate IDs in HTML)
-- Removed obsolete spacer div (using css for styling instead)
-- Corrected immediate closing of bp-group-documents-form tag (invalid HTML)
-- Fixed layout of headings and categories list being bunched up
-- Added a margin at the bottom of bp-group-documents div
-- When no documents exist in a group the 'upload a new document' button no longer overlaps the 'There are no documents...' message in some themes
-- Only output the existing categories list if there are any existing categories
-- Moved submit button to below the categories list (for easier styling customisation)
- Multple invalid HTML fixes and cleanup:
-- Removed unnecessary br tags (use CSS for styling)
-- Added <p> tag around the Valid File Formats text.
-- Added rows and cols attributes to bp-group-documents-description textarea (required for valid HTML)
-- Removed empty label tag
-- Replaced unclosed BR tags with closed BR tags
-- Renamed group-documents-edit-link target from #e to #edit-document-form to remove ambiguity
-- Updated group-documents-icon to bp-group-documents-icon
-- Renamed document-info div to bp-group-documents-document-info for unambiguous & consistent identity
- Added verion caching control for general.js so sites updating plugin will get latest version of the JavaScript
- general.js - updated to adopt changes made from ID to class, and naming consistency
