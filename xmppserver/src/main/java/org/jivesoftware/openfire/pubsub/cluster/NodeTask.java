/**
 * A cluster task used work with a particular pubsub node.

 * As with most cluster tasks, it is important to realize that these tasks are intended to interact only in a limited
 * way with the data on the cluster node where they're executed on. Generally speaking, the cluster node that initiates
 * the task takes responsibility for all of the 'heavy lifting', such as the persistence of data (in the backend data
 * storage/database) for the functionality that the cluster task relates to. The other cluster nodes typically need not
 * to repeat that effort. Specifically, the goal of executing cluster tasks on other cluster nodes should typically be
 * limited to updating in-memory state on the cluster node.
