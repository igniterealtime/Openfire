== ABOUT DESTIN BASIC ==

Create a truly unique design with Destin Basic, a lightweight and fully responsive HTML5 theme. Use the Customizer to add your own page layout, site width and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats, such as: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Compatible with bbPress, BuddyPress and Woocommerce. Uses Google Fonts for improved typeface readability. Designed for desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices.

== NOTES ==

* If you have a drop down list for your site navigation, the parent item should only be a grouping title with a "#" value for the URL parameter. The Bootstrap navbar requires a click to open the drop down list so any link that is set in the parent item will not work.
* If a post does not have a featured image set, the default "No Image" image will appear in order for the home page grid to align properly.
