<h3>Stand Alone Broker</h3>

<p>A stand alone broker requires a single container to run. If you stop and start the container any non-persistent messages are lost, but any persistent messages are preserved.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> that with stand alone brokers; if you lose the machine's files or file system - then all persistent messages will be lost!</p>
