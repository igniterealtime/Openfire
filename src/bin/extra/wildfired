# description: Used to start and stop the wildfire XMPP server
# 
# Script used to start wildfire as daemon
# The script has currently been tested on Redhat Fedora Core 3,
# but should theoretically work on most UNIX like systems
#
# before running this script make sure $WILDFIRE_HOME/bin/wildfire is
# executable by the user you want to run wildfire as
# (chmod +x $WILDFIRE_HOME/bin/wildfire)
#
# This script should be copied into /etc/init.d and linked into
# your default runlevel directory.
# You can find your default runlevel directory by typing: 
# grep default /etc/inittab
#
# Link to the directory like follows
# cd /etc/rc<num>.d
# ln -s ../init.d/wildfired $90wildfired
#

# Set this to tell this script where wildfire lives
# If this is not set the script will look for /opt/wildfire, then /usr/local/wildfire
#export WILDFIRE_HOME=

# If there is a different user you would like to run this script as,
# change the following line
export WILDFIRE_USER=jive

# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# If a wildfire home variable has not been specified, try to determine it
