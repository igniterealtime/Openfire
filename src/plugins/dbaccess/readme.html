<h1>
DB Access Plugin Readme
</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
This plugin provides nothing more than a very simplistic direct DB access tool in the admin console under
Server -&gt; Server Management.  It's purpose is to allow admins to work with their DBs during debugging
sessions to try to determine the state of their DB and maybe make minor adjustments.  It should <b>NOT</b>
be used normally and you should <b>never</b> edit your DB while Openfire is running without knowing absolutely
what you are doing.  Openfire caches a lot of data in the backend and changing things out from under it will
confuse it and probably cause a wealth of problems.  Most likely if you are installing this, it's because
someone asked you to.  =)
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Copy dbaccess.jar into the plugins directory of your Openfire installation. The
plugin will then be automatically deployed. To upgrade to a new version, copy the new
dbaccess.jar file over the existing file.</p>
