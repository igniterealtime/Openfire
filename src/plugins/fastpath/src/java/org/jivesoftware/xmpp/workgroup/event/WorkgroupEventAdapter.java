/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving workgroup events. The methods in this class
 * are empty -- in other words, this class exists as a convenience for creating listener
 * objects.<p>
 *
 * Workgroup Events let you track when a workgroup is destroyed, created, modified, or when a
 * support chat has been created and ended.<p>
 *
 * Extend this class to create a  listener and override the methods for the events of interest.
 * Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
 * a WorkgroupEventDispatcher using the
 * {@link WorkgroupEventDispatcher#addListener(WorkgroupEventListener) addListener} method.
