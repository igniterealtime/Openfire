# Openfire TikiToken plugin

This project is a plugin for the [Openfire Realtime Collaboration Server](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/).

This plugin adds a SASL mechanism that allows users to authenticate against a token that is generated by an instance of [Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware](https://tiki.org/).
