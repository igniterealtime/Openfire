2.9
I was testing with the beta buddypress without bbpress active and noticed the profile pages were not full width- so I have fixed this adding bp_is_user() to the statements in header.php and footer.php.(See http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/template-tag-reference/ for more information on tags).
