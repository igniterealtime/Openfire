<h1>User Import/Export Plugin Readme</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The user import/export plugin provides a way to import and export Jive Messenger 
user data via the Admin Console. The user data consists of jid (aka "username"), 
name, email address, password and roster list (aka "buddy list"). This plugin also 
can aid in the migration of users from other Jabber/XMPP based systems to Jive 
Messenger.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Copy the userImportExport.jar into the plugins directory of your Jive Messenger 
installation. The plugin will then be automatically deployed. To upgrade to a new 
version, copy the new userImportExport.jar file over the existing file.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Presently, there is nothing that can be configured for the user import/export plugin.</p>

<h2>Using the Plugin</h2>
<p> The plugin is accessed via the "User Import & Export" sidebar item located under 
the "Users/Groups" tab in the Admin Console. Note: if you are using LDAP as your user 
data source the following message will appear: "Sorry, because you are using LDAP as 
your user store this plugin will not work with your Messenger installation."
<li>Importing - Select the "Import User Data" option from the user import/export 
selection page. On the import page, notice that the plugin will look for user data 
import files in the MESSENGER_HOME/export directory. In the "Import File Name" field, 
enter the name of the file you want import from and then click on the "Import" button. 
If the plugin is successful in importing all user data, you will be presented with the 
message: "All users added successfully" If the plugin was not successful in importing 
all user data you, will receive a message indicating what might have gone wrong. If 
during the import process, the plugin detects that you are trying to import a user 
that already exists in the system, it will not import that user or any roster 
information.</li>
<li>Exporting - Select the "Export User Data" option from the user import/export 
selection page. User data can be exported either to a file or directly to the screen.
To export to a file, select the "To File" radio button. Notice that the plugin will 
export user data to the MESSENGER_HOME/export directory. In the "Export File Name" 
field, enter the name of the file you want export to and then click on the "Export" 
button. Note: the plugin will automatically append an ".xml" extension to the file 
name if it is not already present. To export to the screen, select the "To Screen"
radio button and then click on the "Export" file. The user data will be placed in
the provided text area.</li>
<li>Migration - To import user data from another instant messenger system using the 
plugin, the import file must conform to the messenger-user-schema.xsd.xml schema file 
(located in the classes directory). When importing a user data file the plugin will 
first validate the file against the schema file." If the  plugin cannot validate the 
import file the user data will not be imported.</li>
