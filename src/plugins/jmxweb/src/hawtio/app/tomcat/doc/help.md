### Tomcat

This plugin works with Tomcat or TomEE to manage the deployed applications, as well viewing information about connectors, sessions and JMX, etc.

The plugin has sub tabs that allows you to see among others the following details:

* Server - Information such as the Tomcat version
* Applications - Lists all deployed web applications
* Connectors - Lists all external connectors such as HTTP/HTTPs listeners
* Sessions - Lists number of active sessions per web application
* JMX - Gives access to the Tomcat MBeans

The Applications sub tab lists all the web applications deployed in Tomcat. The lifecycle of the application(s) can
be controlled using the buttons bar, such as restarting or stopping the applications.

A screen shot of the application tab is shown below
