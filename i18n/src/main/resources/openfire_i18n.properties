offline.messages.title=Offline Messages
offline.messages.update=Settings updated successfully.
offline.messages.info=XMPP provides the option for servers to store-and-forward IM messages when they \
        are sent to a user that is not logged in. Supporting store-and-forward of &#39;offline messages&#39; \
        can be a very convenient feature of an XMPP deployment. However, offline messages, like email, \
        can take up a significant amount of space on a server. There are several options for handling \
        offline messages; select the policy that best suites your needs.
offline.messages.size=Current size of all offline messages:
offline.messages.policy=Offline Message Policy
offline.messages.never_back=Never store offline messages and bounce messages back to the sender.
offline.messages.never_store=Never store offline messages and drop messages so the sender is not notified.
offline.messages.storage_openfire=Store offline messages for later retrieval. Messages will be delivered \
        the next time the recipient logs in. Choose a storage policy and storage store max size below.
offline.messages.always_store=Always Store
offline.messages.always_store_info=Always store messages, even if the max storage size has been exceeded.
offline.messages.bounce=Store or Bounce
offline.messages.bounce_info=Store messages up to the max storage size. After the max size has been exceeded, \
        bounce the message back to the sender.
offline.messages.drop=Store or Drop
offline.messages.drop_info=Store messages for a user up to the max storage size. After the max size has been \
        exceeded, silently drop messages.

# Private data settings Page

private.data.settings.title=Private Data
private.data.settings.update=Settings updated successfully.
private.data.settings.info=Private data storage allows XMPP clients to store settings, bookmarks, etc. on the \
        server. Users can log into their account and their settings will follow them around (as opposed to having \
        the clients store the settings on the local computer where their settings will not follow them). You may \
        enable or disable this feature.
private.data.settings.policy=Set Private Data Policy
private.data.settings.enable_storage=Enable Private Data Storage
private.data.settings.enable_storage_info=allow clients to store information on the server.

# Reg settings Page

reg.settings.title=Registration Settings
reg.settings.info=Use the forms below to change various aspects of user registration and login.
reg.settings.update=Settings updated successfully.
reg.settings.inband_account=Inband Account Registration
reg.settings.inband_account_info=Inband account registration allows users to create accounts on the server \
        automatically using most clients. It does not affect the ability to create new accounts through \
        this web administration interface. Administrators may want to disable this option so users are \
        required to register by other means (e.g. sending requests to the server administrator or through \
        your own custom web interface).
reg.settings.inband_account_readonly=This instance of Openfire is set up to integrate with an external user provider, \
        that is considered to be 'read-only'. Inband account registration is therefore not possible.
reg.settings.enable=Enabled
reg.settings.auto_create_user=Users can automatically create new accounts.
reg.settings.disable=Disabled
reg.settings.not_auto_create=Users can not automatically create new accounts.
reg.settings.change_password=Change Password
reg.settings.change_password_info=You can choose whether users are allowed to change their password. \
        Password changing is independent from inband account registration. However, you may only \
        want to disable this feature when disabling inband account registration.
reg.settings.change_password_readonly=This instance of Openfire is set up to integrate with an external user provider, \
        that is considered to be 'read-only'. Users cannot change their passwords.
reg.settings.can_change=Users can change their password.
reg.settings.cannot_change=Users are not allowed to change their password.
reg.settings.anonymous_login=Anonymous Login
reg.settings.anonymous_login_info=You can choose to enable or disable anonymous user login. If it is \
        enabled, anyone can connect to the server and create a new session. If it is disabled only \
        users who have accounts will be able to connect.
reg.settings.anyone_login=Anyone may login to the server.
reg.settings.only_registered_login=Only registered users may login.
reg.settings.allowed_ips=Restrict Login
reg.settings.allowed_ips_info=Use the form below to define the IP addresses or IP address ranges \
        that are allowed to login. E.g.: 200.120.90.10, 200.125.80.*. Leaving the form empty means \
        that clients will be able to connect from any IP address (unless a blacklist is in place).
reg.settings.ips_all=Restrict ALL (including anonymous) logins to these IP&#39;s:
reg.settings.ips_anonymous=Restrict anonymous logins to these IP&#39;s:
reg.settings.allowed_ips_blocked_info=Use the form below to define the IP addresses or IP address ranges \
        that are not allowed to login. E.g.: 200.120.90.10, 200.125.80.*. Leaving the form empty means \
        that clients will be able to connect from any IP address, unless a whitelist (see below) is in place. \
        Note that entries on the &#39;blocked&#39; list (here) will always take precedence over entries on the &#39;allowed&#39; \
        lists below.
reg.settings.ips_blocked=Do not allow any logins from these IP&#39;s:
reg.settings.future_users=Future Users
reg.settings.future_users_info=In certain configurations and/or highly specific conditions, XMPP functionality can be invoked for a particular user <em>before</em> that user is known to Openfire. An example of this is a scenario in which users are automatically provisioned, which, again, under very specific conditions, can be allowed with specific configuration. Ordinarily, Openfire rejects XMPP functionality in context of a particular user when it does not know of this user. With the configuration below, this behavior can be overridden: when enabling 'Future Users', Openfire will <em>not reject</em> certain XMPP functionality for users that it does not recognize. Instead, it is assumed that the user will be provisioned shortly. This can be used, for example, to record offline messages sent to a user, before that user is provisioned.
reg.settings.future_users_enabled=Allow XMPP functionality that relates to users not (yet) recognized by Openfire.
reg.settings.future_users_disabled=Reject XMPP functionality that relates to users not currently recognized by Openfire.
reg.settings.sasl_mechanisms=SASL Mechanisms
reg.settings.sasl_mechanisms_info=The SASL mechanisms configured below control the mechanism used for authentication. \
        Each mechanism has its own characteristics. The form below is used to control which SASL mechanisms are \
        enabled in Openfire. An implementation must be available for the mechanism to be used, but even if one is, the \
        mechanism might not be offered to clients after all: this could depend on mechanism-specific server settings.
reg.settings.sasl_mechanisms_columntitle_enabled=Enabled
reg.settings.sasl_mechanisms_columntitle_name=Name
reg.settings.sasl_mechanisms_columntitle_implementation=Implementation available
reg.settings.sasl_mechanisms_columntitle_supported=Offered to clients

reg.settings.description.ANONYMOUS=For unauthenticated guest access.
reg.settings.description.PLAIN=Simple cleartext password mechanism.
reg.settings.description.OTP=One-time password mechanism.
reg.settings.description.SKEY=An S/KEY mechanism.
reg.settings.description.CRAM-MD5=Simple challenge-response scheme based on HMAC-MD5.

reg.settings.description.SCRAM-SHA-1=Salted challenge-response scheme based on SHA-1.
reg.settings.description.SCRAM=Challenge-response scheme based mechanism with channel binding support.
reg.settings.description.NTLM=NT LAN Manager authentication mechanism.

system_property.httpbind.client.processing.threads-timeout=Amount of time after which idle, surplus threads are removed from the thread pool to perform the network IO related to websocket and BOSH traffic. See also property 'xmpp.httpbind.worker.timeout'.

system_property.httpbind.client.cert.policy=The TLS 'mutual authentication' policy that is applied to the websocket and BOSH endpoints.
system_property.httpbind.forwarded.enabled=Enable / Disable parsing a 'X-Forwarded-For' style HTTP header of BOSH requests.
system_property.httpbind.forwarded.for.header=The HTTP header name for 'forwarded for'.
system_property.httpbind.forwarded.server.header=The HTTP header name for 'forwarded server'.
system_property.httpbind.forwarded.host.header=The HTTP header name for 'forwarded hosts'.
system_property.httpbind.forwarded.host.name=Sets a forced valued for the host header.
system_property.httpbind.CORS.enabled=Enable / Disable support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers in the BOSH endpoint.
system_property.httpbind.CORS.domains=The domain names that are accepted as values for the CORS 'Origin' header in the BOSH endpoint.
system_property.httpbind.CORS.methods=The HTTP methods that are accepted in requests to the BOSH endpoint.
system_property.httpbind.CORS.headers=The name of HTTP headers that are accepted in requests to the BOSH endpoint.
system_property.httpbind.CORS.max_age=How long the results of a preflight request (that is the information contained in the Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers headers) can be cached.
system_property.httpbind.CSP.enabled=Enable / Disable adding a 'Content-Security-Policy' HTTP header to the response to requests made against the BOSH endpoint.
system_property.httpbind.CSP.responsevalue=The header value when adding a 'Content-Security-Policy' HTTP header to the response to requests made against the BOSH endpoint.
system_property.httpbind.request.header.size=The maximum size in bytes of request headers in the BOSH endpoint. Larger headers will allow for more and/or larger cookies plus larger form content encoded in a URL. However, larger headers consume more memory and can make a server more vulnerable to denial of service attacks.

system_property.adminConsole.sessionTimeout=The maximum idle time of a HTTP session in the admin console.
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.client.maxpause=The maximum length of a temporary session pause that a BOSH client MAY request.
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.client.maxpause.ignore-invalid=Controls if BOSH client-provided 'pause' values that are invalid (higher than 'maxpause') are ignored or will cause the client to be disconnected.
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.client.requests.wait=Returns the longest time that Openfire is allowed to wait before responding to any request of a BOSH session. This enables the client to prevent its TCP connection from expiring due to inactivity, as well as to limit the delay before it discovers any network failure.
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.client.requests.polling=Openfire SHOULD include two additional attributes in the BOSH session creation response element, specifying the shortest allowable polling interval and the longest allowable inactivity period (both in seconds). Communication of these parameters enables the client to engage in appropriate behavior (e.g., not sending empty request elements more often than desired, and ensuring that the periods with no requests pending are never too long).
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.client.requests.max=Openfire MAY limit the number of simultaneous requests a BOSH client makes with the 'requests' attribute. The RECOMMENDED value is "2". Servers that only support polling behavior MUST prevent clients from making simultaneous requests by setting the 'requests' attribute to a value of "1" (however, polling is NOT RECOMMENDED). In any case, clients MUST NOT make more simultaneous requests than specified by the Openfire.
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.client.idle=Period of time a BOSH session has to be idle to be closed. Sending stanzas to the client is not considered as activity. We are only considering the connection active when the client sends some data or heartbeats (i.e. whitespaces) to the server. The reason for this is that sending data will fail if the connection is closed. And if the thread is blocked while sending data (because the socket is closed) then the clean up thread will close the socket anyway.
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.client.idle.polling=Period of time a BOSH polling session has to be idle to be closed. Sending stanzas to the client is not considered as activity. We are only considering the connection active when the client sends some data or heartbeats (i.e. whitespaces) to the server. The reason for this is that sending data will fail if the connection is closed. And if the thread is blocked while sending data (because the socket is closed) then the clean up thread will close the socket anyway.
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.worker.threads-min=Minimum amount of threads used to process incoming BOSH data. See also property 'httpbind.client.processing.threads-min'.
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.worker.threads=Maximum number of threads used to process incoming BOSH data. Defaults to the same amount of threads as what's used for non-BOSH/TCP-connected XMPP clients. Note: Apart from the processing threads configured in this class, the server also uses a thread pool to perform the network IO (see property 'httpbind.client.processing.threads'). BOSH installations expecting heavy loads may want to allocate additional threads to this worker pool to ensure timely delivery of inbound packets.
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.worker.timeout=Duration that unused, surplus threads that once processed BOSH data are kept alive. See also property 'httpbind.client.processing.threads-timeout'
system_property.xmpp.httpbind.worker.cleanupcheck=Interval in which a check is executed that will cleanup unused/inactive BOSH sessions.

system_property.provider.transfer.proxy.threadpool.keepalive=The number of threads in the thread pool that powers proxy (SOCKS5) connections is greater than the core, this is the maximum time that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.
system_property.xmpp.pep.enabled=Enables / disables PEP support in Openfire.
system_property.xmpp.pep.threadpool.size.core=The number of threads to keep in the thread pool used to send PEP notifications, even if they are idle.

# Store Management page

ssl.certificates.store-management.title=Certificate Stores
ssl.certificates.store-management.info-1=Certificates are used (through TLS and SSL protocols) to establish secure connections between servers and clients. When a secured connection is being created, parties can retrieve a certificate from the other party and (amongst others) examine the issuer of those certificates. If the issuer is trusted, a secured layer of communication can be established.
ssl.certificates.store-management.info-2=Certificates are kept in specialized repositories, or &#39;stores&#39;. Openfire provides two types of stores: <ul><li><em>Identity stores</em> are used to store certificates that identify this instance of Openfire. On request, the certificates from these stores are transmitted to other parties which use them to identify your server. </li> <li><em>Trust stores</em> contain certificates that identify parties that you choose to trust. Trust stores often do not include the certificate from the remote party directly, but instead holds certificates from organizations that are trusted to identify the certificate of the remote party. Such organizations are commonly referred to as "Certificate Authorities".</li></ul>
ssl.certificates.store-management.info-3=This section of the admin panel is dedicated to management of the various key and trust stores that act as repositories for sets of security certificates.
ssl.certificates.store-management.info-4=By default, a small set of stores is re-used for various purposes (as shown on this page), but Openfire <a href="security-certificate-store-management.jsp?showAll=true">allows you to configure a distinct set of stores for each connection type</a>.
ssl.certificates.store-management.combined-stores.title=Certificate Stores
ssl.certificates.store-management.combined-stores.info=These stores are used for all encrypted communication. Three stores are provided\: one identity store, a trust store for server-based connections, and a trust store for client-based connections.
ssl.certificates.store-management.socket-c2s-stores.title=XMPP Client Stores
ssl.certificates.store-management.socket-c2s-stores.info=These stores are used for regular, TCP-based client-to-server XMPP communication. Two stores are provided\: one identity store and a trust store. Openfire ships with an empty trust store, as in typical environments, certificate-based authentication of clients is not required.
ssl.certificates.store-management.socket-s2s-stores.title=Server Federation Stores
ssl.certificates.store-management.socket-s2s-stores.info=These stores are used for server-to-server XMPP communication, which establishes server federation. Two stores are provided\: one identity store and a trust store. Openfire ships with a trust store filled with certificates of generally accepted certificate authorities.
ssl.certificates.store-management.bosh-c2s-stores.title=Web binding (websocket and BOSH) Stores
ssl.certificates.store-management.bosh-c2s-stores.info=These stores are used for web binding (websocket and BOSH) based XMPP communication. Two stores are provided\: an identity store and a client trust store.

ssl.certificates.keystore.no_installed=A certificate for the domain of this server is missing. Click {0}here{1} to generate a self-signed \
  certificate or {2}here{3} to import a signed certificate and its private key.
ssl.certificates.keystore.no_complete_installed=The installed certificate does not cover all of the identities of this \
  server. Click {0}here{1} to replace your certificate with a self-signed certificate that does, or {2}here{3} to import \
  a signed certificate and its private key.

  Verify that the reply is correct and that it belongs to the correct certificate.
ssl.certificates.keystore.issuer-updated=Issuer information updated successfully.
ssl.certificates.keystore.ca-reply-imported=Certificate Authority reply was imported successfully.
ssl.certificates.keystore.intro=This page lists certificates that are used to identify this Openfire instance.
ssl.certificates.keystore.info=Openfire can generate certificates that are <em>self-signed</em>. The \
  issuer of those certificates is the Openfire instance itself. Although remote parties can choose to trust servers \
  that provide a self-signed certificate, this is rare, and, from a security perspective, questionable.</p><p>The \
  certificates that are used to identify this Openfire instance should be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that \
  is commonly trusted by clients and other servers. This page allows you to generate a Certificate Signing Request \
  (CSR), which you can use to obtain a signed certificate from such a Certificate Authority. After you obtain a reply \
  from the CA to the CSR, that reply can be inserted in this page to install a CA signed certificate.</p>\
  <p>Alternatively, a certificate might already be made available though other means. In the this case the signed \
  certificate and corresponding private key can be {0}imported here{1}.
ssl.certificates.keystore.self-signed.info=Self-signed certificates should be signed by a Certificate Authority to be \
  trusted and accepted by clients and other servers.
ssl.certificates.keystore.signing-pending.info=The certificate is not yet signed by a Certificate Authority. A signing \
  request should be sent to the Certificate Authority so that it can be signed by the CA. The CA will return a new \
  certificate once it has been approved and signed. The returned certificate will need to be imported into the server.
ssl.certificates.keystore.ca-signed.info=The certificate has been signed by a Certificate Authority. Clients and \
  servers are expected to accept the certificate unless they do not trust the Certificate Authority that signed the \
  certificate.

# DNS SRV Records check
system.dns.srv.check.title=DNS SRV Record verification
system.dns.srv.check.name=Current DNS Configuration Evaluation
system.dns.srv.check.info=To compose the information on this page, a DNS SRV query has been made, using the value of <tt>{0}</tt>, which is the XMPP domain name that is configured for Openfire. Any resulting records are inspected for a match against the value of <tt>{1}</tt>, which is the fully qualified domain name of the server that is running Openfire, as {2}configured here{3}.
system.dns.srv.check.rationale=Without a valid DNS SRV record, clients are likely to have trouble connecting to your server. Even when clients provide a manual connect host, it is likely that they provide a different value than the fully qualified domain name that is configured for your server, which will cause problems with certain authentication mechanisms. It is recommended to have a DNS SRV record for this XMPP domain that matches the fully qualified domain name of the server on which you are running this instance of Openfire.
system.dns.srv.check.example=It is expected that your DNS configuration has at least two SRV records, which are similar to this (values like TTL, priority and weight are examples, and might be different in your configuration):
system.dns.srv.check.disclaimer=Note that changes that have been applied to DNS configuration might take a while to propagate. It might take some time for Openfire to be able to see the changes that were made to your DNS configuration.
system.dns.srv.check.detected_matching_records.one-liner=Successfully identified A DNS SRV record for this host.
system.dns.srv.check.detected_matching_records.description=The DNS SRV records for this XMPP domain contain one that matches this server.
system.dns.srv.check.xmppdomain_equals_hostname.one-liner=No DNS SRV records for this host are found, but none are needed.
system.dns.srv.check.xmppdomain_equals_hostname.description=There are no DNS SRV records for this XMPP domain, but as the fully qualified domain name of this host is equal to the XMPP domain name, none are needed.
system.dns.srv.check.no-records.one-liner=No DNS SRV records for this host are found.
system.dns.srv.check.no-records.description=There appear to be no DNS SRV records at all for this XMPP domain. With the current configuration of Openfire, it is recommended that DNS SRV records are created for this server.
system.dns.srv.check.no-match.one-liner=DNS SRV records do not include this host.
system.dns.srv.check.no-match.description=DNS SRV records for this XMPP domain are found, but none of them match the fully qualified domain name of this server. This typically occurs when the DNS SRV record uses a different identifier for this host than the fully qualified domain name as configured in Openfire. This should be corrected, as it is known to cause problems with certain authentication mechanisms. Another possibility is that this instance of Openfire is part of a cluster, but has not yet been included in the DNS configuration.
