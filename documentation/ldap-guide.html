<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    This document details how to configure your Openfire installation to use
    an external directory such as Open LDAP or Active Directory. Integration with a directory
    lets users authenticate using their directory username and password. Optionally, you can
    configure Openfire to load user profile and group information from the directory. Any group in
    Openfire can be designated as a shared group, which means that you can pre-populate user's
    rosters using directory groups.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) has emerged as a dominant standard
    for user authentication and for storage of user profile data. It serves as a
    powerful tool for large organizations (or those organizations integrating many
    applications) to simplify user management issues. Many LDAP servers are available,
    such as <a href="http://www.openldap.org/">Open LDAP</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/">Active Directory</a>, 
    and Novell's <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/edirectory/">eDirectory</a>.

</p>

<p>
    By default, Openfire stores all user data in its database and performs
    authentication using database lookups. The LDAP module replaces that
    functionality and allows Openfire to:
    <ul>
        <li>Use a LDAP server to authenticate a user's identity.</li>
        <li>Load user profile information from a LDAP directory.</li>
        <li>Load group information from an LDAP directory.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Note:</b> Openfire treats the LDAP directory as read-only.
</p>

<p>
    This document will guide you through configuring LDAP support in Openfire. These
    instructions assume that you're a competent LDAP user, and that you're familiar
    with Openfire setup issues.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
    The Openfire setup tool includes an easy to use LDAP setup wizard.
    Choose the LDAP option on the Profile Settings page to configure directory integration.
    The wizard along with in-line help will guide you through the rest of the process.
    <a href="#activedirectory">Specific tips</a> for working with Active Directory are noted below.

    <br clear="left"/>

    If you have already completed the setup process but need to enable LDAP integration, you
    can re-run the setup tool. To do so:
    <ol>

        <li>
            Stop Openfire.
        </li>
        <li>Edit <tt>conf/openfire.xml</tt> in your Openfire installation folder and set
            &lt;setup&gt;true&lt;/setup&gt; to &lt;setup&gt;false&lt;/setup&gt;.
        </li>
        <li>
            Restart Openfire and enter the setup tool.
        </li>
    </ol>

</p>

<h2><a name="activedirectory">Working with Active Directory</a></h2>

<p>Microsoft's Active Directory is a broadly deployed directory system that supports the
LDAP protocol. You'll be prompted for several LDAP fields when connecting to Active Directory
servers, some of which are detailed below:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Base DN</b><br/><br/>
        <p>The base DN describes where to load users and groups. If you're using a default
            Active Directory setup, all user accounts and groups are located in the
            "Users" folder under your domain. In LDAP form, that's <tt>cn=Users;dc=&lt;Your Domain&gt;</tt>.
            To get more specific, say your domain is <tt>activedirectory.jivesoftware.com</tt>. In that case,
            your base DN would be <tt>cn=Users;dc=activedirectory,dc=jivesoftware,dc=com</tt>. If
            you've customized where users are stored, you'll just need to replicate that folder
            structure using LDAP syntax.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Administrator DN</b><br/><br/>
        <p>By default, Active Directory does not allow anonymous LDAP connections. Therefore,
            you'll need to enter the DN of a user that's allowed to connect to the server and read
            all user and group data. Unless you've created a special user account for this
            purpose, an easy choice is to use the built-in administrator account. By default,
            the administrator DN is in the form <tt>cn=Administrator,dc=&lt;Your Domain&gt;</tt>.
            Using our previous example,
            <tt>cn=Administrator,cn=users,dc=activedirectory,dc=jivesoftware,dc=com</tt>.
        </p>
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>Manually Editing the Config File</h3>

<p>
    If you prefer to edit the configuration file to enable LDAP integration directly, use the following
    instructions. Open the configuration file <tt>conf/openfire.xml</tt> from your Openfire
    installation in your favorite
    editor and add or change the following settings. Properties flagged with (<font color="red">
    <b>*</b></font>)
    must be set. Properties flagged with (<font color="red"><b>**</b></font>) must be set in order
    to enable LDAP group
    support, all other properties are optional:

</p>
<ul>
    <b>Main Settings</b><br><br>

    <li>provider.user.className <font color="red"><b>*</b></font> -- set the value to
        "org.jivesoftware.openfire.ldap.LdapUserProvider".</li>
    <li>provider.auth.className <font color="red"><b>*</b></font> -- set the value to
        "org.jivesoftware.openfire.ldap.LdapAuthProvider".</li>

    <li>ldap.host <font color="red"><b>*</b></font> -- LDAP server host; e.g. localhost or
        machine.example.com, etc. It is possible to use many LDAP servers but all of them
        <b>should share the same configuration</b> (e.g. SSL, baseDN, admin account, etc).
        To specify many LDAP servers use the comma or the white space character as delimiter.</li>
    <li>ldap.port -- LDAP server port number. If this property is not set, the default value is
        389.</li>
    <li>ldap.connectionTimeout -- The value of this property is the string representation of an integer
        representing the connection timeout in milliseconds. If the LDAP provider doesn't
        connect within the specified period, it aborts the connection attempt. The integer should
        be greater than zero. An integer less than or equal to zero means no connection timeout is specified in which
        case the default 4 seconds timeout is used. <i>Does not apply to SSL connections.</i></li>
    <li>ldap.readTimeout -- The value of this property is the string representation of an integer
        representing the read timeout in milliseconds for LDAP operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't
        get an LDAP response within the specified period, it aborts the read attempt. The integer should
        be greater than zero. An integer less than or equal to zero means no read timeout is specified which
        is equivalent to waiting for the response infinitely until it is received which defaults
        to the original behavior. <i>Requires Java 1.6 or later.</i></li>
    <li>ldap.baseDN <font color="red"><b>*</b></font> -- the starting DN that searches for users
        will performed with. The entire subtree under the base DN will be searched for user accounts.
    </li>

    <li>ldap.alternateBaseDN -- a second DN in the directory can optionally be set. If set, the
        alternate base DN will be used for authentication, loading single users and displaying a
        list of users. Content in the base DN and the alternate DN will be treated as one.
    <li>ldap.adminDN -- a directory administrator's DN. All directory operations will be
            performed
            with this account. The admin must be able to perform searches and load user records. The
            user does
            not need to be able to make changes to the directory, as Openfire treats the
            directory as read-only.
            If this property is not set, an anonymous login to the server will be attempted.
        </li>
    <li>ldap.adminPassword -- the password for the directory administrator.</li>
    <li>ldap.usernameField -- the field name that the username lookups will be performed on. If
            this property is not set, the default value is <tt>uid</tt>. Active Directory users
            should try the default value <tt>sAMAccountName</tt>.</li>
    <li>ldap.nameField -- the field name that holds the user's name. If this property is not
            set, the default value is <tt>cn</tt>. Active Directory users should use the default value
            <tt>displayName</tt>.</li>

    <li>ldap.emailField -- the field name that holds the user's email address. If this property
            is not set, the default value is <tt>mail</tt>. Active Directory users should use the
            the default value <tt>mail</tt>.</li>
     <li>ldap.searchFields -- the LDAP fields that will be used for user searches. If
        this property is not set, the username, name, and email fields will be searched. An example
        value for this field is "Username/uid,Name/cname". That searches the uid and cname fields
        in the directory and labels them as "Username" and "Name" in the search UI. You can add
        as many fields as you'd like using comma-delimited "DisplayName/Field" pairs. You should
        ensure that any fields used for searching are properly indexed so that searches return
        quickly.</li>
    <li>ldap.searchFilter -- an optional search filter to append to the default filter when
        loading users. The default search filter is created using the attribute specified by
        ldap.usernameField. For example, if the username field is "uid", then the default search
        filter would be "(uid={0})" where {0} is dynamically replaced with the username being searched
        for.
        <br/><br/>
        The most common usage of a search filter is to limit the entries that are users
        based on objectClass. For example, a reasonable search filter for a default Active Directory
        installation is "(objectClass=organizationalPerson)". When combined with the default
        filter, the actual search executed would be
        "(&(sAMAccountName={0})(objectClass=organizationalPerson))".</li>
    <li>ldap.subTreeSearch -- by default, Openfire will search the entire LDAP sub-tree (starting
        at the base DN) when trying to load users. If this property is set to <tt>false</tt>, then
        sub-tree searching is disabled and users will only be loaded directly from the base DN.
        Disabling sub-tree can improve performance, but it will fail to find users if your directory
        is setup to use sub-folders under the base DN.</li>

    <br><br>
    <b>Group Settings</b><br><br>

    <li>provider.group.className <font color="red"><b>**</b></font> -- set the value to
        "org.jivesoftware.openfire.ldap.LdapGroupProvider".</li>
    <li>ldap.groupNameField <font color="red"><b>**</b></font> -- the field name that the groupname
        lookups will be performed on. If this property is not set, the default value is <tt>cn</tt>.</li>
    <li>ldap.groupMemberField -- the field name that holds the members in a group. If this property
        is not set, the default value is <tt>member</tt>.</li>

    <li>ldap.groupDescriptionField -- the field name that holds the description a group. If this
        property is not set, the default value is <tt>description</tt>.</li>
    <li>ldap.posixMode <font color="red"><b>**</b></font> -- a value of "true" means that users are
        stored within the group by their user name alone. A value of "false" means that users are
        stored by their entire DN within the group. If this property is not set, the default value
        is <tt>false</tt>. The posix mode must be set correctly for your server in
        order for group integration to work. Posix modes for common LDAP servers:
        <ul>
            <li>ActiveDirectory: false</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>ldap.groupSearchFilter -- an optional search filter to append to the default filter when
        loading groups. The default group search filter is created using the attribute specified
        by ldap.groupNameField. For example, if the group name field is "cn", then the default
        group search filter would be "(cn={0})" where {0} is dynamically replaced with the group
        name being searched for.
        <br/><br/>
        The most common usage of a search filter is to limit the entries that are groups
        based on objectClass. For example, a reasonable search filter for a default Active Directory
        installation is "(objectClass=group)". When combined with the default
        filter, the actual search executed would be
        "(&(cn={0})(objectClass=group))".</li>

    <br><br>
    <b>Connection Settings</b><br><br>

    <li>ldap.debugEnabled -- a value of "true" if debugging should be turned on. When on, trace
            information about buffers sent and received by the LDAP provider is written to
            System.out</li>
    <li>ldap.sslEnabled -- a value of "true" to enable SSL connections to your LDAP server. If
            you
            enable SSL connections, the LDAP server port number most likely should be changed to
            636.</li>
    <li>ldap.startTlsEnabled -- a value of "true" to enable StartTLS connections to your LDAP server. If
            you enable StartTLS connections, the LDAP server port number most likely should be changed to
            389.</li>
    <li>ldap.initialContextFactory -- the name of the class that should be used as an initial
        context
        factory. if this value is not specified, "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory" will be used
        instead.
        Most users will not need to set this value.
    <li>ldap.autoFollowReferrals -- a value of "true" indicates that LDAP referrals should be
        automatically followed. If this property is not set or is set to "false", the referral policy used is left
        up to to the provider. A referral is an entity that is used to redirect a client's request to
        another server. A referral contains the names and locations of other objects. It is sent by the server to
        indicate that the information that the client has requested can be found at another location (or
        locations), possibly at another server or several servers.
    <li>ldap.connectionPoolEnabled -- a value of "false" disables LDAP connection pooling. If this
        property is not set, the default value is "true".

</ul>

<p>
    Below is a sample config file section:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;jive&gt;
      ...
      &lt;ldap&gt;

        &lt;host&gt;&lt;/host&gt;
        &lt;port>389&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;usernameField&gt;uid&lt;/usernameField&gt;
        &lt;nameField&gt;cn&lt;/nameField&gt;

        &lt;emailField&gt;mail&lt;/emailField&gt;
        &lt;baseDN&gt;ou=People;dc=example;dc=com&lt;/baseDN&gt;
        &lt;adminDN&gt;cn=Directory Administrator&lt;/adminDN&gt;
        &lt;adminPassword&gt;&lt;/adminPassword&gt;

      &lt;/ldap&gt;
      &lt;provider&gt;
        &lt;user&gt;
          &lt;className&gt;org.jivesoftware.openfire.ldap.LdapUserProvider&lt;/className&gt;
        &lt;/user&gt;

        &lt;auth&gt;
          &lt;className&gt;org.jivesoftware.openfire.ldap.LdapAuthProvider&lt;/className&gt;
        &lt;/auth&gt;
        &lt;group&gt;
          &lt;className&gt;org.jivesoftware.openfire.ldap.LdapGroupProvider&lt;/className&gt;

        &lt;/group&gt;
      &lt;/provider&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/jive&gt;
</pre>

<p>You'll most likely want to change which usernames are authorized to login to the
    admin console. By default, only the user with username "admin" is allowed to login. However,
    you may have different users in your LDAP directory that you'd like to be administrators. The
    list of authorized usernames is controlled via the <tt>admin.authorizedUsernames</tt>
    property. For example, to let the usersnames "joe" and "jane" login to the admin console:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;jive&gt;
      ...
      &lt;admin&gt;
        ...
        &lt;authorizedUsernames&gt;joe, jane&lt;/authorizedUsernames&gt;
      &lt;/admin&gt;

      ...
    &lt;/jive&gt;
</pre>

<p><a name=""><h2>Custom Search Filter</h2></a></p>

<p>By default, Openfire will load all objects under the baseDN that
    have the attribute specified by <tt>ldap.usernameField</tt>. In the
    case that the username field is set to "uid", the search for all users
    would be "(uid=*)". However, there are cases when this logic does
    not work -- for example, when a directory contains other objects besides
    users but all objects share "uid" as a unique identifier field. In that
    case, you may need to specify a custom search filter using
    <tt>ldap.searchFilter</tt>. As an example, a search filter for all users
    with a "uid" and a "cn" value of "joe" would
    be:</p>

<pre>(&(uid={0})(cn=joe))</pre>

<p>The "{0}" value in the filter above is a token that should be present in
    all custom search filters. It will be dynamically replaced with "*" when
    loading the list of all users or a username when loading a single user.</p>

<p>Some custom search filters may include reserved XML entities such as
    "&". In that case, you must enter the search filter into the openfire.xml
    file using CDATA:

    <pre>&lt;searchFilter&gt;&lt;![CDATA[(&(sAMAccountName={0})(|(givenName=GEORGE)(givenName=admin)))]]&gt;&lt;/searchFilter&gt;</pre>

    <p><a name="ctxFactory"><h2>Custom Inital Context Factory</h2></a></p>

    <p>

        Some LDAP servers or application servers may require that a different LDAP
        initial context factory be used rather than the default (com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory).
        You can set a custom initial context factory by adding the following to openfire.xml:

<pre>
  &lt;ldap&gt;
    ... other ldap settings here
    &lt;initialContextFactory&gt;com.foo.factoryClass&lt;/initialContextFactory&gt;
  &lt;/ldap&gt;</pre>
    </p>

    <p><a name="connectionPool"><h2>Connection Pooling</h2></a></p>

    The default LDAP provider (Sun's) support pooling of connections to the LDAP
    server. Connection pooling can greatly improve performance, especially on
    systems with high load. Connection pooling is enabled by default, but can
    be disabled by setting the Jive property <tt>ldap.connectionPoolEnabled</tt>
    to <tt>false</tt>:

    <pre>&lt;ldap&gt;
        ... other ldap settings here
        &lt;connectionPoolEnabled&gt;false&lt;/connectionPoolEnabled&gt;

        &lt;/ldap&gt;</pre></p>

<p>
    You should set several Java system properties to change default pool settings.
    For more information, see the following pages:
    <ul>

        <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/connect/pool.html">
            http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/connect/pool.html</a>
        <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/connect/config.html">
            http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/connect/config.html</a>

    </ul>
</p>

<p>Note that if you turn on LDAP debugging, connection pooling will not be enabled.
    If SSL LDAP mode is enabled, you must set a system property to enable pooling of
    SSL LDAP connections.</p>

<p><a name="vcard"><h2>LDAP vCard Integration</h2></a></p>

<p>The LDAP vCard provider will expose LDAP profile information as vCard data for XMPP
clients that support the XMPP vCard extension. First, enable the provider:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;provider&gt;

      ...
      &lt;vcard&gt;
        &lt;className&gt;org.jivesoftware.openfire.ldap.LdapVCardProvider&lt;/className&gt;
      &lt;/vcard&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/provider&gt;
</pre>

<p>Next, you must add mappings between LDAP fields and vCard fields in the openfire.xml file.
    The vcard attributes are configured by adding an attrs="attr1,attr2" attribute to the vcard
    elements. Arbitrary text can be used for the element values as well as MessageFormat style
    placeholders for the ldap attributes. For example, if you wanted to map the LDAP attribute
    displayName to the vcard element FN, the XML snippet would be:
    &lt;FN attrs="displayName"&gt;{0}&lt;/FN&gt;</p>

<p>The vCard XML must be escaped in CDATA and must also be well formed. It is the exact
    XML this provider will send to a client after after stripping attr attributes and populating
    the placeholders with the data retrieved from LDAP. This system should be flexible enough to
    handle any client's vCard format. An example mapping follows.</p>

<pre>
    &lt;ldap&gt;
      &lt;vcard-mapping&gt;
        &lt;![CDATA[
          &lt;vCard xmlns='vcard-temp'&gt;

            &lt;FN&gt;{displayName}&lt;/FN&gt;
            &lt;NICKNAME&gt;{uid}&lt;/NICKNAME&gt;
            &lt;BDAY&gt;{dob}&lt;/BDAY&gt;

            &lt;ADR&gt;
              &lt;HOME/&gt;
              &lt;EXTADR&gt;Ste 500&lt;/EXTADR&gt;
              &lt;STREET&gt;317 SW Alder St&lt;/STREET&gt;
              &lt;LOCALITY&gt;Portland&lt;/LOCALITY&gt;
              &lt;REGION&gt;Oregon&lt;/REGION&gt;
              &lt;PCODE&gt;97204&lt;/PCODE&gt;
              &lt;CTRY&gt;USA&lt;/CTRY&gt;
            &lt;/ADR&gt;

            &lt;TEL&gt;
              &lt;HOME/&gt;
              &lt;VOICE/&gt;
              &lt;NUMBER&gt;{telephoneNumber}&lt;/NUMBER&gt;
            &lt;/TEL&gt;

            &lt;EMAIL&gt;
              &lt;HOME/&gt;
              &lt;INTERNET/&gt;
              &lt;PREF/&gt;
              &lt;USERID&gt;{mail}&lt;/USERID&gt;
            &lt;/EMAIL&gt;

            &lt;TITLE&gt;{title}&lt;/TITLE&gt;
            &lt;ROLE&gt;&lt;/ROLE&gt;

            &lt;ORG&gt;
              &lt;ORGNAME&gt;{o}&lt;/ORGNAME&gt;
              &lt;ORGUNIT&gt;&lt;/ORGUNIT&gt;

<h2>LDAP FAQ</h2>

<p>

    <b>Can I create new users through Openfire when using LDAP?</b>
    <ul>No, Openfire treats LDAP directories as read-only. Therefore, it's
        not possible to create or edit users through the application.</ul>

    <b>Why is the list of usernames not sorted in the admin console when using LDAP?</b>
    <ul>Several popular LDAP servers such as OpenLDAP do not support server-side
        sorting of search results. On those servers, users will appear out of order.
        However, you can enable client-side sorting of search results by setting
        <tt>ldap.clientSideSorting</tt> to true in the XML configuration file.</ul>

    <b>I switched to LDAP and now cannot login to the admin console. What happened?</b>
    <ul>If you can no longer login to the admin console after switching, one of two
        things most likely happened:<ol>
        <li>By default, only the username "admin" is allowed to login to the
            admin console. Your directory may not contain a user with a username
            of "admin". In that case, you should modify the list of usernames authorized
            to login to the admin console (see above).
        <li>You may have set the baseDN to an incorrect value. The LDAP module
            recursively searches for users under the node in the directory specified
            by the baseDN. When the baseDN is incorrect, no users will be found.
    </ol>
        You can also enable debugging to get more information from the LDAP module. To
        do this, add &lt;log&gt;&lt;debug&gt;&lt;enabled&gt;true&lt;/enabled&gt;&lt;/debug&gt;&lt;/log&gt;

        to your <tt>conf/openfire.xml</tt> file. Log statements will be written
        to the <tt>logs/debug.log</tt> file.
    </ul>
