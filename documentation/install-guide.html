<p>Openfire is a powerful instant messaging (IM) and chat
server that implements the XMPP protocol. This document will guide 
you through installing Openfire. For a full list of features and more information, please
visit the Openfire website: <a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/"
 target="_top">http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Select Openfire installer that is better suiting you (with or without Java JRE, x86 or x64). Run the installer. The application will be installed to <tt>C:\Program Files\Openfire</tt> by default.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> On Windows systems we suggest using a service to run Openfire (read the Windows Service section below). When using Openfire Launcher on Windows Vista or newer with UAC protection enabled, it has to be run with Run as administrator option, to be able to write changes to config and embedded database (if used) stored in <tt>C:\Program files\Openfire\</tt> folder. If Openfire is running via launcher without Run as administrator option from Program files, it can't get proper permissions to write changes. It shows errors (in red) when running the launcher and during the setup will require the current password for the administrator account (although this is a new installation and normally it doesn't ask for it). This is an effect of missing permissions and Openfire not being able to initialize the database and other resources.</p>
 <p><b>Since 4.1.5 Openfire installs and runs the service automatically (also opens the browser and loads the web setup page). The launcher (if one wants to use it) is also made to run in elevated mode, so one don't need to run it as administrator manually. But you shouldn't use the launcher, if the service is running. Because this will create a conflict.</b></p>
    
 <h3>Linux</h3>
 
 <p>Choose one of the provided installers (x86 or x64, with or without Java JRE, rpm, deb or tar.gz).</p>

    If using rpm, run it using your package manager to install Openfire to <tt>/opt/openfire</tt>:
        <p><tt>rpm -ivh openfire_X_Y_Z.rpm</tt></p>

 If using deb, run it to install Openfire to <tt>/usr/share/openfire</tt>:
    <p><tt>dpkg -i openfire_X_Y_Z.deb</tt></p>

 If using the tar.gz, extract the archive to <tt>/opt</tt> or <tt>/usr/bin</tt>:
 <p><tt>tar -xzvf openfire_X_Y_Z.tar.gz<br>
 mv openfire /opt</tt></p>

    <h3>macOS</h3>
    <p>Install Openfire using dmg installer. This should install Openfire into <tt>/usr/local/openfire</tt>. Then you can run it via cmd or with the launcher.</p>

 <p><b>Note:</b> some Openfire installers do not contain a bundled Java runtime (JRE). Therefore, you must have JDK or JRE installed on your system. Openfire 4.3 (also 4.2 and older versions) requires Java 8. Starting with 4.4 version Openfire also supports Java 11.
     You can check your java version by typing "java -version" at the command line. We suggest using OpenJDK, which is usually provided as a package on Linux or you can download it for various platforms from <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">AdoptOpenJDK</a>.</p>

  </ul>
<h2>Setup Overview</h2>
<p>To complete the installation of Openfire, you'll need to
perform each of the following steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#database">Database</a> - if you choose to use an external database, you must
 prepare your database for Openfire. </li>
  <li><a href="#config">Setup</a> - Use the built-in web-based setup
tool to setup and verify the server configuration.</li>

  <li><a href="#tools">Admin Console</a> - use the web-based admin tool to
manage the server.</li>
</ol>

<p>This document also includes information on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#windows">Running under Windows</a>
    <li><a href="#unix">Running under Unix/Linux</a>

    <li><a href="#plugins">Installing and using plugins</a>
</ul>

<h2><a name="distribution">Files in the Distribution</a></h2>
<p> The files in your distribution should be as follows (some
sub-directories omitted for brevity): </p>
<pre>openfire/
 |- readme.html
 |- license.html
 |- conf/
 |- bin/
 |- jre/
 |- lib/
 |- plugins/
     |- admin/
 |- resources/
     |-database/
     |-security/
 |- documentation/</pre>

<ul> 
     <li>The <tt>conf</tt> directory is where Openfire stores
configuration files.</li>

  <li>The <tt>bin</tt> directory contains the server executables. Depending
on which distribution you installed, different executables will be available.</li>
  <li>The <tt>jre</tt> directory contains a Java runtime that is bundled with the Windows and RPM versions of Openfire.</li>
  <li>The <tt>lib</tt> directory contains libraries necessary for
running Openfire.</li>

  <li>The <tt>plugins</tt> directory contains server plugins. By
default, Openfire ships with a web-based admin console plugin.</li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/database</tt> directory contains SQL schema files to
create new Openfire databases, as well as upgrade scripts for
existing installations. </li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/security</tt> directory is where Openfire
maintains keystores to support SSL connection security.</li>

  <li>The <tt>documentation</tt> directory contains server
documentation.</li>
</ul><p>

<h2><a name="database">Setup the Database</a></h2>
<p>Openfire can store its data in an embedded database or you can choose to use
an external database such as MySQL or Oracle. If you would like to use an external database,
you must prepare it before proceeding with installation. View the <a href="database.html">database
setup</a> documentation for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="config"></a>Setup the Server</h2>
<p>A web-based, "wizard" driven setup and configuration tool is built
into Openfire. Simply launch Openfire (platform-specific instructions below) and use a web browser to
connect to the admin console. The default port for the
web-based admin console is 9090. If you are on the same machine as Openfire, the
following URL will usually work: 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:9090">http://127.0.0.1:9090</a>. Initial setup and administration can also be done
from a remote computer using LAN IP address instead or hostname if it is resolvable by the remote computer.
Windows Server administrators should add http://127.0.0.1 address to Internet Explorer's Trusted Sites list, if
Enhanced Security configuration is enabled in Internet Explorer. Otherwise they will get a blank screen.</p>

<h3><a name="autosetup"></a>Autosetup</h3>
<p>As an alternative to the web-based "wizard" driven setup described above, Openfire can be configured by provisioning it
with a specially crafted <tt>openfire.xml</tt> file.</p>
<p>If <tt>&lt;setup&gt;true&lt;>/setup&gt;</tt> does not exist in <tt>openfire.xml</tt> (i.e. setup is not complete, and a block
does exist called <tt>&lt;autosetup&gt;</tt> with a <tt>&lt;run&gt;true&lt;/run&gt;</tt> property inside it, that looks like this:</p>
<tt><pre>
    &lt;autosetup&gt;
        &lt;run&gt;true&lt;/run&gt;
        &lt;locale&gt;en&lt;/locale&gt;
        &lt;xmpp&gt;
            &lt;domain&gt;localhost&lt;/domain&gt;
            &lt;fqdn&gt;localhost&lt;/fqdn&gt;
            &lt;auth&gt;
                &lt;anonymous&gt;true&lt;/anonymous&gt;
            &lt;/auth&gt;
            &lt;socket&gt;
                &lt;ssl&gt;
                    &lt;active&gt;true&lt;/active&gt;
                &lt;/ssl&gt;
            &lt;/socket&gt;
        &lt;/xmpp&gt;
        &lt;encryption&gt;
            &lt;algorithm&gt;AES&lt;/algorithm&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;some-key&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;/encryption&gt;
        &lt;database&gt;
            &lt;mode&gt;standard&lt;/mode&gt;
            &lt;defaultProvider&gt;
                &lt;driver&gt;org.postgresql.Driver&lt;/driver&gt;
                &lt;serverURL&gt;jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/a-database&lt;/serverURL&gt;
                &lt;username&gt;a-database&lt;/username&gt;
                &lt;password&gt;a-password&lt;/password&gt;
                &lt;minConnections&gt;5&lt;minConnections&gt;
                &lt;maxConnections&gt;25&lt;maxConnections&gt;
                &lt;connectionTimeout&gt;1.0&lt;connectionTimeout&gt;
            &lt;/defaultProvider&gt;
        &lt;/database&gt;
        &lt;admin&gt;
            &lt;email&gt;admin@example.com&lt;/email&gt;
        &lt;password&gt;admin&lt;/password&gt;
        &lt;/admin&gt;
        &lt;authprovider&gt;
            &lt;mode&gt;default&lt;/mode&gt;
        &lt;/authprovider>
        &lt;users&gt;
            &lt;user1&gt; &lt;!-- Use incremental numbers for more users, eg: user2, user3 --&gt;
                &lt;username&gt;jane&lt;/username&gt; &lt;!-- Required --&gt;
                &lt;password&gt;secret&lt;/password&gt; &lt;!-- Required --&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Jane Doe&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;email&gt;user1@example.org&lt;/email&gt;
                &lt;roster&gt;
                    &lt;item1&gt; &lt;!-- Use incremental numbers for more items, eg: item2, item3 --&gt;
                        &lt;jid&gt;john@example.com&lt;/jid&gt;
                        &lt;nickname&gt;John&lt;/nickname&gt;
                    &lt;/item1&gt;
                &lt;/roster&gt;
            &lt;/user1&gt;
        &lt;/users&gt;
    &lt;/autosetup&gt;
</pre></tt>
<p>Then setup will be run on first launch, and the <tt>&lt;autosetup/&gt;</tt> section will be deleted from <tt>openfire.xml</tt></p>
<p>Note that autosetup provides less options to setup Openfire as compared to using the setup wizard.</p>

<h2><a name="tools">Admin Console</a></h2>
<p>After completing the above steps, Openfire will be configured
and you can use the web-based admin console to administer
the server. The URL should be the same as you used to setup the server
unless you changed the port during the setup.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="windows">Running Openfire on Windows</a></h2>

<p>Since 4.1.5 version Openfire automatically installs and runs the service (and opens the browser with the web setup page). But you can also use the launcher, if you need to 
(service has to be stopped before running the launcher). If you used the Openfire installer, a shortcut for starting the 
graphical launcher is provided in your Start Menu. Otherwise, run openfire.exe in the <tt>bin/</tt> directory of your
Openfire installation. A button on the launcher allows you to automatically open your web browser to the correct URL 
to finish setting up the server: 
</p>

<h3>Windows Service</h3>
<p>As of 4.1.5 Openfire installs the service automatically. But if you are using older version or want to reinstall the service,
you can use the <tt>openfire-service.exe</tt> executable in the <tt>bin</tt> directory of the installation to install or uninstall
the service.

</p>

From a console window, you can run the following commands:
<ul>
        <li><tt>openfire-service /install</tt> -- installs the service.
        <li><tt>openfire-service /uninstall</tt> -- uninstalls the service.
        <li><tt>openfire-service /start</tt> -- starts the service
        <li><tt>openfire-service /stop</tt> -- stops the service.

</ul>

<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/windows_service.png" alt="Windows Service" width="557" height="223" align="center">
</div>
</p>

<p>You can also use the Services tool in the Windows Control Panel to start and
stop the service.</p>

<p>Note: the graphical launcher is not compatible with the Windows service. If you install the service, you should use service controls
as described above to control the server rather than the graphical launcher.</p>

<p><b>Upgrading Note:</b> you should stop Openfire service before running the installer to upgrade to the newer version. Starting
with 4.1.5 version Openfire will automatically stop and reinstall the service when upgrading with the installer.</p>

<h3>Custom Parameters</h3>

<p>Advanced users may wish to pass in parameters to the Java virtual machine (VM) to customize
    the runtime environment of Openfire. You can do this by creating openfire.vmoptions files in the bin/
    directory of your Openfire installation. For the Windows service, you'd create a new text
    file called openfire-service.vmoptions. Each parameter to the VM should be on a new line of
    the file. For example, to set the minimum heap size to 512 MB and max VM heap size to 1024 MB, you'd use:

<pre>-Xms512m
-Xmx1024m</pre>

To create parameters for the normal launcher, create a file called openfired.vmoptions (since
    the openfire.exe launcher invokes the openfired.exe executable to actually start the server).</p>

<h2><a name="unix">Running Openfire in Linux/Unix</a></h2>

If you are running on a Red Hat or Red Hat like system (CentOS, Fedora, etc), we recommend using the
RPM as it contains some custom handling of the standard Red Hat like environment.  Assuming that you
have used the RPM, you can start and stop Openfire using the <tt>/etc/init.d/openfire</tt> script.

<p>
<tt>
# /etc/init.d/openfire<br>
Usage /etc/init.d/openfire {start|stop|restart|status|condrestart|reload}<br>
# /etc/init.d/openfire start<br>
Starting openfire:
</tt>
</p>


If you are running on a different Linux/Unix varient, and/or you have used the .tar.gz 'installer',
you can start and stop Openfire using the <tt>bin/openfire</tt> script in your Openfire installation:

<p>
<tt>
# ./openfire<br>

Usage: ./openfire {start|stop}<br>
# ./openfire start<br>
Starting openfire
</tt></p>

If you would like to install Openfire as a service, two scripts are provided in the <tt>bin/extra</tt>
directory:
<ul>
    <li>redhat-postinstall.sh --   automatically installs Openfire as a service on Red Hat. It does so by creating a "jive" user and then copying the openfired script to your init.d directory. This script must be run as root. Please see the comments in the script for additional information.</li>
    <li>openfired -- script to run Openfire as a service. You must manually configure this script. See the comments in
the script for additional details.</li>
</ul>
<b>It is not recommended that you use either of these scripts if you installed via RPM.  The RPM has already taken care of what these scripts take care of.</b>

<h3>Custom Parameters</h3>

<p>Advanced users may wish to pass in parameters to the Java virtual machine (VM) to customize
    the runtime environment of Openfire. If you installed via RPM, you can customize this by
    editing /etc/sysconfig/openfire and looking at the OPENFIRE_OPTS option.  If you installed
    via .tar.gz, you will need to tweak your startup script to fit your needs.</p>

<h2><a name="plugins">Plugins</a></h2>

Plugins add additional features and protocol support to Openfire. After setting up your
Openfire installation, you may want to download and install plugins to enhance your
server. Plugins can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins.jsp">plugins page</a> on igniterealtime.org
or directly inside the administration console.

<h3>Installing Plugins</h3>

<p>If you download a plugin from inside the Openfire administration console, it will automatically
be installed. If you manually download the plugin (packaged as a .jar file), you can deploy it
by copying the plugin file to the <tt>plugins/</tt> directory of your Openfire installation. A
plugin monitor will automatically extract the plugin into a directory and install the plugin in Openfire.
You may also use the "upload plugin" feature in the admin console (under the Plugins tab) to load
a plugin from your local file system to the server.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For nearly all plugins, a restart of the Openfire
server software is not required.  You should be able to install and remove
plugins on-demand without impacting Openfire.</p>


<h3>Managing Plugins</h3>

Plugins can be managed inside the Openfire admin console. You can also manually delete a plugin at any time by
deleting its JAR file (Openfire will automatically remove the plugin from memory and delete it's directory when you
do so).
    
<h2><a name="plugins">Firewall</a></h2>
    
Server's administrator should open TCP port 5222 for incoming connections for XMPP clients to be able to connect to Openfire.
Additionally an administrator can also open TCP 9090 (for http) and TCP 9091 (for https), if there is a need to remotely administrate
Openfire connecting to its Admin Console. We recommend only using 9091 port as it is an encrypted connection. For server to server
connections one should also open TCP 5269 port and for secure HTTP-BIND connections TCP 7443 port. Port number can be different, if
the default configuration has been changed by an administrator. All ports used by Openfire can be found on the first page of 
Admin Console in the Server Ports section.
