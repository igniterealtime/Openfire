/**
 * Represents the amount of history requested by an occupant while joining a room. There are 
 * basically four ways to control the amount of history that a user may receive. Those are: limit
 * by the maximum limit of characters to receive, limit by a maximum number of stanzas to receive,
 * limit to receive only the messages before a given date or of the last X seconds.<p>
 * 
 * A user may combine any of these four methods. The idea is that the user will receive the smallest 
 * amount of traffic so the amount of history to collect will stop as soon as any of the requested 
 * method has reached its limit.
