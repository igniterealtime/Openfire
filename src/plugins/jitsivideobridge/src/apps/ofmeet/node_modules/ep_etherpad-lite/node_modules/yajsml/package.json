It is a server-side component\nthat allows JavaScript code to be distributed in a reliable and performant way.\nIts three features are:\n\n - Proxy pass through for individual resource requests.\n - Bulk responses for requests of closely associated resources (e.g.\n   dependencies) when a request specifies a JSONP-style callback.\n - Canonical packaged resources where requests for disparate resources may be\n   fulfilled through a redirect to one canonical packaged resource (which\n   exploits warmed caches).\n\nThe tool’s interface is simple enough that there is no need for a prescribed\nimplementation on the client-side. That said, the\n[require-kernel](https://github.com/cweider/require-kernel) is a terse\nimplementation of a CommonJS module manager that can use all the features in\nyajsml.\n\n## License ##\nReleased under the MIT license.\n\n    Copyright (c) 2011 Chad Weider\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\n    copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\n    to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\n    the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\n    and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\n    Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
