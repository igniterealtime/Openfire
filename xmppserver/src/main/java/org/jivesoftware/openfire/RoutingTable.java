/**
 * <p>Maintains server-wide knowledge of routes to any node.</p>
 * <p>Routes are only concerned with node addresses. Destinations are
 * packet handlers (typically of the three following types):</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Session - A local or remote session belonging to the server's domain.
 * Remote sessions may be possible in clustered servers.</li>
 * <li>Chatbot - A chatbot which will have various packets routed to it.</li>
 * <li>Transport - A transport for foreign server domains. Foreign domains
 * may be hosted in the same server JVM (e.g. virutal hosted servers, groupchat
 * servers, etc).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>In almost all cases, the caller should not be concerned with what
 * handler is associated with a given node. Simply obtain the packet handler
 * and deliver the packet to the node, leaving the details up to the handler.</p>
 * <p>Routes are matched using the stringprep rules given in the XMPP specification.
 * Wildcard routes for a particular name or resource is indicated by a null. E.g.
 * routing to any address at server.com should set the name to null, the host to
 * 'server.com' and the resource to null. A route to the best resource for user@server.com
 * should indicate that route with a null resource component of the XMPPAddress. Session
 * managers should add a route for both the generic user@server.com as well as
 * user@server.com/resource routes (knowing that one is an alias for the other
 * is the responsibility of the session or session manager).</p>
 * <p>In order to accomodate broadcasts, you can also do partial matches by querying
 * all 'child' nodes of a particular node. The routing table contains a forest of
 * node trees. The node tree is arranged in the following heirarchy:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>forest - All nodes in the routing table. An XMPP address with host, name, and resource set
 * to null will match all nodes stored in the routing table. Use with extreme caution as the
 * routing table may contain hundreds of thousands of entries and iterators will be produced using
 * a copy of the table for iteration safety.</li>
 * <li>domain root - The root of each node tree is the server domain. An XMPP address
 * containing just a host entry, and null in the name and resource fields will match
 * the domain root. The children will contain both the root entry (if there is one) and
 * all entries with the same host name.</li>
 * <li>user branches - The root's immediate children are the user branches. An
 * XMPP address containing just a hast and name entry, and null in the resource field
 * will match a particular user branch. The children will contain both the user branch
 * (if there is one) and all entries with the same host and name, ignoring resources.
 * This is the most useful for conducting user broadcasts. Note that if the user
 * branch is located on a foreign server, the only route returned will the server-to-server
 * transport.</li>
 * <li>resource leaves - Each user branch can have zero or more resource leaves. A partial
 * match on an XMPP address with values in host, name, and resource fields will be equivalent
 * to the exact match calls since only one route can ever be registered for a particular. See
 * getBestRoute() if you'd like to search for both the resource leaf route, as well as a valid user
 * branch for that node if no leaf exists.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Note: it is important that any component or action affecting routes
 * update the routing table immediately.</p>
