  "readme": "# require-kernel #\n\nThis is an implementation of the [CommonJS module standard](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1) for a browser environment.\n\n## Usage ##\n\nThe kernel is a code fragment that evaluates to an unnamed function.\n\n### Interface ###\n\nModules can be loaded either synchronously and asynchronously:\n\n* `module = require(path)`\n* `require(path1[, path2[, ...]], function (module1[, module2[, ...]]) {})`\n\nThe kernel has the following methods:\n\n* `define`: A method for defining modules. It may be invoked one of several ways. In either case the path is expected to be fully qualified and the module a function with the signature `(require, exports, module)`.\n  * `require.define(path, module)`\n  * `require.define({path1: module1[, path2: module2[, ...]]})`\n* `setGlobalKeyPath`: A string (such as `\"require\"` and `\"namespace.req\"`) that evaluates to the kernel in the global scope. Asynchronous retrieval of modules using JSONP will happen if and only if this path is defined. Default is `undefined`.\n* `setRootURI`: The URI that non-library paths will be requested relative to. Default is `undefined`.\n* `setLibraryURI`: The URI that library paths (i.e. paths that do not match `/^\\.{0,2}\\//`) will be requested relative to. Default is `undefined`.\n* `setRequestMaximum`: The maximum number of concurrent requests. Default is `2`.\n\n## Behavior ##\n\n### JSONP ###\n\nIf a global key path was set for the kernel and the request is allowed to be asynchronous, a JSONP will be used to request the module. The callback parameter sent in the request is the `define` method of `require` (as specified by the global key path).\n\n### Cross Origin Resources ###\n\nJSONP accomplishes CORS, so if such a request is possible to make, it is made, else, if the user agent is capable of such a request, requests to cross origin resources can be made, if not (IE[6,7]), the kernel will attempt to make a request to a mirrored location on the same origin (`http://static.example.com/javascripts/index.js` becomes `http://www.example.com/javascripts/index.js`).\n\n## License ##\n\nReleased to the public domain.
