## Bookmarks Plugin Resource Bundle
##
## Additional locales can be specified by creating a new resource file in this
## directory using the following conventions:
##
##   bookmarks_i18n "_" language "_" country ".properties"
##   bookmarks_i18n "_" language ".properties"
##
## e.g.
##    bookmarks_i18n_en.properties      <- English resources
##    bookmarks_i18n_en_US.properties   <- American US resources
##    bookmarks_i18n_de.properties      <- German resources
##    bookmarks_i18n_ja.properties      <- Japanese resources
##
## Please note that the two digit language code should be lower case, and the
## two digit country code should be in uppercase. Often, it is not necessary to
## specify the country code.
##
## A full list of language codes can be found at
## http://www-old.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt
## and a full list of country codes can be found at
## http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_3166.html
##
## In property strings that are parameterized, single quotes can be used to
## quote the "{" (curly brace) if necessary. A real single quote is represented by ''.
