JSON.minify()\n\tv0.1 (c) Kyle Simpson\n\tMIT License\n*/\n\nJSON.minify() minifies blocks of JSON-like content into valid JSON by removing all \nwhitespace *and* comments.\n\nJSON parsers (like JavaScript's JSON.parse() parser) generally don't consider JSON\nwith comments to be valid and parseable. So, the intended usage is to minify \ndevelopment-friendly JSON (with comments) to valid JSON before parsing, such as:\n\nJSON.parse(JSON.minify(str));\n\nNow you can maintain development-friendly JSON documents, but minify them before\nparsing or before transmitting them over-the-wire.\n\nThough comments are not officially part of the JSON standard, this post from\nDouglas Crockford back in late 2005 helps explain the motivation behind this project.\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/json/message/152\n\n\"A JSON encoder MUST NOT output comments. A JSON decoder MAY accept and ignore comments.\"\n\nBasically, comments are not in the JSON *generation* standard, but that doesn't mean\nthat a parser can't be taught to ignore them. Which is exactly what JSON.minify()\nis for.\n\nThe first implementation of JSON.minify() is in JavaScript, but the intent is to\nport the implementation to as many other environments as possible/practical.\n\nNOTE: As transmitting bloated (ie, with comments/whitespace) JSON would be wasteful\nand silly, this JSON.minify() is intended for use in server-side processing\nenvironments where you can strip comments/whitespace from JSON before parsing\na JSON document, or before transmitting such over-the-wire from server to browser.\n\n# install \n\n## npm repo\n\n```\n$ npm install jsonminify\n```\n\n##  npm source\n\n```\n$ npm install https://github.com/fkei/JSON.minify.git\n```\n\n# example\n\n\n```javascript\nvar jsonminify = require(\"jsonminify\");\n\njsonminify('{\"key\":\"value\"/** comment **/}')\n>> '{\"key\":\"value\"}'\n\nJSON.minify('{\"key\":\"value\"/** comment **/}')\n>> '{\"key\":\"value\"}'\n```\n\n# build\n\n```\n$ make\n```\n\n# release\n\n```\n$ make release\n```\n\n# test\n\n```\n$ make test\n```\n\n# jshint\n\n```\n$ make jshint\n```\n\n# Document\n\n- [JSDoc - API Document](http://fkei.github.io/JSON.minify/docs/index.html)\n- [Plato - Report](http://fkei.github.io/JSON.minify/report/index.html)\n- [Mocha - Test result (HTML)](http://fkei.github.io/JSON.minify/TestDoc.html)\n\n# Web-Site\n\n**[Github pages - JSON.minify Home Page](http://fkei.github.io/JSON.minify/)**\n\n# LICENSE\n\nforked from [getify/JSON.minify](https://github.com/getify/JSON.minify)\n\n```\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
